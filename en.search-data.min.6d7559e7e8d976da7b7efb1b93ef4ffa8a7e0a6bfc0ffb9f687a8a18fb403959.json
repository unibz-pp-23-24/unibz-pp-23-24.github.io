It is identical to a regular folder, except for a hidden folder named .git. This folder stores (among others) the whole history of the project. Commit # A commit is a snapshot of a repository. Each commit has medatada associated to it. In particular:\nan ID, the name of the commit\u0026rsquo;s author, a timestamp, a message that describes the commit. For instance, Alice may create a fresh git repository, add some files to it, and commit these files. After this step, Alice\u0026rsquo;s repository may be pictured as follows.\nNext, Alice may modify some of these files (and/or add new ones), and commit these changes:\nNotation. In the figures below, for readability, we will omit the commits\u0026rsquo; metadata. So the above repository will be represented as:\nMain branch # By default, Alice\u0026rsquo;s commits belong the main branch of her repository (often called main or master). You can think of a branch as a timeline.\nGit keeps tack of the latest commit on this branch with a so-called \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo; (you can think of it as a variable) to that commit: Time travel # Alice can load any previous snapshot of her repository. The history of the repository will not be affected.\nTo achieve this, Git uses another \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo; called HEAD, which intuitively keeps track of the current position of Alice in the commit\u0026rsquo;s history. By default, HEAD points to the main pointer: If Alice decides to load her previous snapshot (thanks to the git checkout command), then HEAD will instead point to the corresponding commit: In this case (i.e. when it does not point to a branch pointer, but directly to a commit), the HEAD pointer is said to be in a detached state.\nBranching time # Alice may want to work on an experimental feature of her project. She can develop this feature in an \u0026ldquo;alternative timeline\u0026rdquo;, a.k.a. another branch.\nBefore creating this new branch, Alice most likely wants to travel back to her latest commit. This will move the HEAD pointer back to where it was:\nNow Alice may create a new branch, and name it myFeature. This will create a new branch pointer:\nAlice can also specify that she want to work on this new branch (using the git checkout command still). This will affect the HEAD pointer:\nNext, Alice may implement (part of) her new feature, and commit these changes. This will move the myfeature pointer forward:\nNow Alice may need to fix an urgent bug on her main branch. If she switches to the main branch (again, with git checkout), then HEAD will point to it:\nAlice may fix the bug and commit her changes. This will create a commit and move the main pointer as expected. The two branches now diverge:\nThen Alice may switch back to the myFeature branch to resume her work:\nAnd add a commit to this branch:\nHistory # The history of a branch consists of all commits on a path from the branch\u0026rsquo;s pointer to the original commit. For instance, this is the history of the myFeature branch: And this is the history of main branch: Merging branches # We left Alice\u0026rsquo;s repository in this situation: Alice is now satisfied with her new feature, and she wants to incorporate it into her main branch.\nTo do so, she first switches to the receiving branch (in this case, the main branch): Then she can merge the branch myFeature into the branch main. Because the two branches have diverged, this will generate a new commit, called a merge commit:\nBefore she can create a merge commit, Alice may need to fix potential conflicts between the diverging branches.\nIn this happens, then git will provide Alice a list of files that contain so-called \u0026ldquo;merge conflicts\u0026rdquo;. In each of theses files, each conflict will be identified as follows:\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; HEAD \u0026lt;Conflicting content from the receiving branch\u0026gt; ======= \u0026lt;Conflicting content from the merged branch\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;mergedBranchName\u0026gt; After a merge # Observe that a merge commit (usually) has two parent commits. More generally:\na repository with merge commits is not a tree. in such a repository, the history of a \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo; may consists of commits from different paths. For instance, here is the history of the main branch: Note that after this merge, all commits of the myFeature branch are part of the history of the branch main.\nAlice may keep the myFeature branch for some future usage, or she may decide to delete it. In the latter case, the myFeature pointer will simply be deleted:\nFast-forward merge # If two branches have not diverged, then there is a simpler way to merge them.\nFor instance, consider Carol\u0026rsquo;s repository:\nThe branches main and experimental have not diverged. So experimental can be merged into main by simply moving the main pointer:\nIn this case, no merge commit is needed. This is called a fast-forward merge.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/background/sections/problem/","title":"Computational problem","section":"Background","content":" Computational problem # A computational problem is (usually) specified as:\na set of possible inputs, and the expected outputs (for these inputs). Problem vs algorithm # For instance, here is a problem that you may have encountered already:\nInput: a sorted array A of integers, an integer a Output: true if a appears in A, false otherwise There are (infinitely) many algorithms that can solve this problem. But some of them are more efficient than others. Efficiency (a.k.a. computational cost) refers to the time and/or memory needed to execute an algorithm, expressed as a function of the size of the input (more on this later).\nExercise Can you think of (or do you already know) an algorithm that can solve this problem efficiently? Why is it efficient? Solution Algorithm. Let n be the size of A, and let us assume for simplicity that arrays are 1-indexed and that A is nonempty.\nIf n = 1, then check whether A[1] = a. Otherwise: check whether A[n/2] = a (where \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo; is integer division, rounded up or down if n is odd), depending on the result, repeat on either the left or the right half of A. Cost. If A has length n, then the number of iterations of the procedure is (in the order of) log2 _n in the worst case (e.g. if a does not appear in A).\nHere is another problem that you may know:\nInput: an array of integers Output: an array with the same values, but sorted in ascending order And yet another:\nInput: a solvable grid of sudoku Output: the same grid, solved Note. A problem specifies what a program should do, not how to do it. In other words, a computational problem is not an algorithm. For instance, the following is not a computational problem:\nInput: an array of integers. Algorithm: initialize a counter to 1. Then iterate through the array, and: increment the counter each time 2 consecutive numbers are encountered, and reset the counter to 1 otherwise. Exercise Which problem does this algorithm solve? Solution Input: an array A of integers Output: the length of the longest suffix of A that consists of consecutive numbers Formulating a problem # When developing a project, it can be helpful to express some sub(tasks) as computational problems. This is also a common way to document your code.\nFor instance the Javadoc of a class may consist of computational problems (e.g. the Javadoc for the method indexOf of the class String in Java).\nWhen formulating a problem, make sure that:\nthe output is specified for all inputs, and the formulation is non-ambiguous, meaning that it should clearly specify whether any given pair (input, output) is correct. Exercise Consider the class Unit (and its subclasses), as defined in the section about inheritance. The following problem is not properly defined. Can you see why?\nInput: a nonempty array A of instances of the class Unit Output: the unicorn with highest health in A Solution There may be no unicorn in A, or several healthiest unicorns. Exercise The following problem is not properly defined. Can you see why?\nInput: a (finite) family of (finite) sets Output: the smallest set that has a nonempty intersection with each of the input sets (where \u0026ldquo;smallest\u0026rdquo; here refers to the size of a set) For instance, for the input\n{ {a,c,k}, {a,b}, {a,m}, {c,d,f}, {c,e} } the expected output is\n{a,c} Solution Some inputs admit more than one solution (the simplest example is the input {a,b}). Note. A problem may admit several outputs for the same input without being ambiguous. For instance:\nInput. a graph G, two nodes s and t in G, Output: one of the shortest paths from s to t in G if any, and null otherwise. A problem may be undecidable, meaning that for any algorithm attempting to solve this problem, there (provably) exist (infinitely many) inputs for which the algorithm either produces an incorrect output or does not terminate. A problem may be decidable but intractable, meaning that (provably) no efficient algorithm can solve it (where cost is once again measured as a function of the size of the input).

This means that your application:\ndoes not necessarily need a graphical user interface (but you may choose to develop one), should perform non-trivial backend task(s) (e.g. writing and/or reading to/from files is not sufficient). Guidelines # Motivation # A good projects is driven by an idea.\nFeel free to design your application so that it matches your own interests. For instance:\nrelate it to a hobby (music, cinema, fashion, sport, games, social media, astronomy, etc.), use the project as an opportunity to explore a topic that you are curious about (natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems, robotics, etc.), develop a functionality that one of your favorite applications is missing. Do not hesitate to be ambitious at first. You can restrict the scope of your project (to certain features or components) later on.\nSpecification # A frequent source of failure for this course is students focusing on tools (e.g. following tutorials) without having a precise objective. The short deadline (June 2024) does not give you this flexibility. Besides, without a precise objective, the amount of libraries that are available to you (especially in Java) can be overwhelming.\nSo we recommend you to clarify what your application should do, before thinking about how you could implement it. In other words, specify which problem(s) (i.e. input and expected output) your program and/or components should solve. Then only think about algorithms, libraries, tools and/or tutorials that can help you solve these problems.\nIn order to determine whether your specification is precise enough, you may check whether it leaves some doubt as to whether an output is correct or not.\nUser interface # Developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) requires familiarity with a graphical framework. Learning the details of such a framework (terminology, syntax, setup, etc.) can be an important time investment, and this knowledge may not transfer to other graphical frameworks. In other words, developing a GUI may not require lot of thinking, but a lot of reading (and web browsing).\nBeware also that GUIs technologies are still rapidly evolving, and that recent innovation has largely been driven by web development. So learning a graphical framework for Java may not be a strategic investment of your time (compared to learning a Javascript framework like React or Angular). Note that even desktop and mobile applications are increasingly relying on web technologies for their GUIs (thanks to frameworks like Electron or React Native).\nThis is why we recommend you to think carefully before committing to a Java GUI, and to keep it minimal if you do. Note also that we will not evaluate your project based on aesthetic criteria.\nSo in order to design your interface, you may follow the following guidelines:\nAsk yourself whether your application really needs a GUI. A command-line interface (CLI) may be sufficient, because: your program takes files as input and produces files as output, or your program is (primarily) meant to be used by other programs (rather than human beings), or your program is meant to be used by other developers, or external programs with GUIs (such as IDEs) can easily call your application, or you leave the GUI for future work (again, your application is just a prototype), etc. If you really need a GUI, then: decouple frontend and backend (whenever possible), so that the backend could be used with another frontend, and conversely.\nExample. Many applications accessible via GUI have a natural decoupling of frontend and backend. For instance, consider an application that allows booking hotel rooms. The backend takes as input some data (e.g. number or guests, duration, etc.), and outputs data as well (available rooms, prices, etc.). These input and output are independent of the aspect or structure of the GUI (windows, menus, buttons, fields, etc.). Example. Even for some games, frontend and backend can easily be decoupled. Consider for instance a program that plays chess against a human opponent. The backend:\nkeeps track of the current state of the board, takes as input either a move from the white player, or a request to play as the black player, outputs the next state of the board. These input and output do not depend on a specific GUI (they can for instance be encoded using algebraic notation). So the backend can be implemented without any reference to graphical elements or controller inputs (mouse clicks, etc.).\ndevelop the backend first (and write unit tests for it),\ndevelop the frontend afterwards (if you have time for it).\nIf you really need a GUI, then try to keep it minimal. In particular, restrict the input to what is essential for your application. The more freedom the user is given, the more likely he/she is to input a sequence of actions that your program cannot handle. Examples # Here are some examples of (past and imaginary) possible projects:\na program that detects texts generated by a large language model, a program that takes as input a dataset of Tweets and identifies communities and/or influencers based on the network formed by re-tweets, a program that retrieves news articles about an input topic (using web APIs), and analyses their polarity (via sentiment analysis) together with their provenance (news outlet, country, etc.), a (toy) recommender system, a program that generates (solvable) sudoku grids with different sizes and/or level of difficulty, a game to help people improve their typing speed, a web crawler that retrieves sport-related statistics from various websites and exposes them via a web API, a classroom reservation system for the Unibz that can computes a default schedule for a whole semester, satisfying a set of constraints (room capacity, etc.) and/or preferences (minimize days of presence per week of a same group, etc.), a flashcard app that incorporates answers produced by a chatbot, an (Obsidian-like) note management application, a program to organize and manage coding contests (similar to this one), a password manager (with encryption), for instance similar to pass, where password update and synchronization are performed via git, a program that analyzes the commit and/or branching history of a git repository (e.g. contributions of the different users, frequency of commits, percentage of preserved code, etc.).

To this end, she can upload some of her branches to a remote machine (often called \u0026ldquo;a remote\u0026rdquo;). For instance use a cloud hosting service for git repositories (such as GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.).\nWhenever Alice wants to upload the content of a branch, she can push this branch to the remote.\nAlice may also want to work from another computer (or a virtual machine). She can achieve this by cloning the repository from the remote to this second machine.\nWarning. By default, cloning a repository will only clone the main branch. But other branches (or all branches) can also be cloned explicitly. Note. When two machines share a git branch, each of them has a copy of the full history of the branch. Note. A branch can be shared with several remote servers (e.g. one for releases and one for development or continuous integration). For these two reasons, git is sometimes called a \u0026ldquo;distributed\u0026rdquo; versioning system.\nCollaboration # Enters Bob\u0026hellip;\nBob may want to collaborate with Alice on her project. He can clone Alice\u0026rsquo;s repository, and add his own commits.\nIn order to synchronize their work, Alice and Bob may agree to share the content of one or several branches (for instance the main branch).\nWarning. For a smooth collaboration, code on a shared branch is expected to:\ncompile and pass all unit tests defined for the project. A basic workflow # Alice and Bob share the main branch of their repository, and this branch is called main. This generally means that there are (at least) 3 copies of this branch: one on Alice\u0026rsquo;s machine, one on Bob\u0026rsquo;s machine, and one on the remote.\nHowever Alice and Bob, do not work directly on this branch. Instead, each of them works on his/her own development branch (e.g. called alice and bob respectively).\nBackup # Alice regularly pushes the content of the branch alice to the remote, for backup purposes only. And so does Bob for the branch bob.\nHowever, Alice does not need a local copy of bob, and Bob does not need a local copy of alice.\nSharing # Bob has been working on a new feature, on the branch bob. His code compiles and passes all unit tests. He now feels ready to share this code with Alice (via the branch main).\nHowever, Alice may have added commits to the main branch since Bob last looked at it.\nIn order to share his work, Bob:\nswitches to (his local copy of) main (with the git checkout command), then updates his local copy of main (with the git pull command), then merges main into bob (this may require fixing merge conflicts), then merges bob into main, then pushes main to the remote. And Alice follows the same procedure to share her code (using alice instead of bob).\nTo go further # There is a vast literature (and diverging opinions) on collaborative git workflows. This is beyond the scope of this course.\nNote that many of these workflows incorporate so-called \u0026ldquo;pull requests\u0026rdquo;, which are a mechanism for to notify team members of your team that you have completed a feature. Pull requests are not a functionality of git itself, but of (some) git hosting services. To learn more about pull requests, you may consult the corresponding GitHub or Atlassian guides.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/objects/sections/classes/","title":"Class and instance","section":"Objects and classes","content":" Class and instance # A class can be viewed as a blueprint for a set of similar objects.\nFor instance, consider the two objects:\n{ name: \u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, zipCode: 50100, region: \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34; } { name: \u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, zipCode: 00100, region: \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34; } Each of these objects describes a city, and they share the same keys (name, zipCode and region). A possible class for these two objects may enforce this structure, and it could be named City. An object that follows this blueprint is called an instance of this class.\nDeclaration # In a typed language (like Java), a class must specifies not only the \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo; of its instances, but also their types. For instance, the class City could be declared as follows in Java:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; ... } In Java, a class is often declared in a dedicated file. This file must have the same name as the class (e.g. City.java in this example). The three variables (name, zipCode and region) are called attributes (or sometimes member variables).\nConstructor # A class also needs a special method called a constructor. The constructor is in charge of creating a (fresh) instance of the class. In Java (as in Python, C#, etc.), the constructor does not return the instance itself, but a reference (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;pointer\u0026rdquo;) to this instance.\nNote. A class may have several constructors (with different signatures). Writing a constructor in Java # The constructor of a Java class must have the same name as the class. For instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String n, int z, String r){ name = n; zipCode = z; region = r; } ... } Note. In this example, the variable names n, z and r are not very explicit. However, using name, zipCode and region would be ambiguous (because these names are already used for the attributes of the class). In Java, we can use the prefix this. to refer to attribute names, thus eliminating the ambiguity.\nFor instance:\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; String region; public City(String name, int zipCode, String region){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipcode; this.region = region; } ... } Calling a constructor in Java # A Java constructor is called with the keyword new. For instance:\nCity myCity = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100, \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;); City yourCity = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); Note. The object that is created in memory contains extra information, in particular a reference to its class. This allows type checking, casts, etc. (more on this later). Accessing an object in Java # The attributes of an object can be accessed like regular variables, using ., followed by the name of the attribute. For instance,\nCity thatCity = new City(\u0026#34;Siena\u0026#34;, 53100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Wrong region: \u0026#34; + thatCity.region); thatCity.region = \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;; System.out.println(\u0026#34;Better now: \u0026#34; + thatCity.region); will output\nWrong region: Lazio Better now: Tuscany Reference type vs primitive type # Recall that a Java constructor returns a reference to the object that it creates. So in the example above, the value of each variable (myCity and yourCity) is a reference, not the object itself.\nThis also holds for:\nvariables of type String, variable with an array type (like int[] myArray). The types of these variables (e.g. City, String or int[]) are called reference types.\nSyntax. In Java, types that start with a capital letter (like City or Array\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;) are usually reference types. Types that are not references types (like int or char) are called primitive types.\nThe value of a reference cannot be output (printed, displayed, etc.) by a program. But this value can be modified or compared to another.\nExercise What is the output of the following program?\nCity aCity = new City(\u0026#34;Matera\u0026#34;, 75100, \u0026#34;Basilicata\u0026#34;); City theSameCity = new City(\u0026#34;Matera\u0026#34;, 75100, \u0026#34;Basilicata\u0026#34;); System.out.println(aCity == theSameCity); System.out.println(aCity.zipCode == theSameCity.zipCode); System.out.println(aCity.name == theSameCity.name); Solution false true false Exercise What is the output of the following program?\nCity anotherCity = new City(\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34;, 40100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); City yetAnotherCity = new City(\u0026#34;Mantua\u0026#34;, 46100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); yetAnotherCity.name = anotherCity.name; System.out.println(yetAnotherCity.name); anotherCity = yetAnotherCity; System.out.println(anotherCity.zipCode); System.out.println(anotherCity == yetAnotherCity); Solution Exercise 2.\n\u0026#34;Bologna\u0026#34; 46100 true Passing by value or by reference # Programming languages differ in the way arguments are passed to methods. Two common strategies are:\npassing by value: the method receives as input a copy of each argument, passing by reference: the method receives as input a reference to each argument. Consider for instance the following program (in pseudocode):\nint myInteger = 0 myMethod(myInteger) print(myInteger) void myMethod(int argument){ argument += 1 } If the argument is passed by value, then the program will print 0. If the argument is passed by reference, then the program will print 1. Java passes by value # In Java (and many other programming languages, like C, Python, Javascript, etc.), arguments are passed by value. So the above program translated in Java will print 0.\nWarning. Consider a method with a reference type argument. Because Java passes by value, this method will receive a copy of this argument. But this is a copy of the reference, not a copy of the object itself. Exercise What does the following Java program print?\nint myInteger = 0; City myFirstCity = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100, \u0026#34;Tuscany\u0026#34;); City mySecondCity = new City(\u0026#34;Mantua\u0026#34;, 46100, \u0026#34;Emilia-Romagna\u0026#34;); myMethod(myInteger, myFirstCity, mySecondCity); System.out.println(myInteger); System.out.println(myFirstCity.zipCode); System.out.println(mySecondCity.zipCode); public void myMethod(int integer, City firstCity, City secondCity){ integer += 1; System.out.println(integer); firstCity.zipCode = 20590; System.out.println(firstCity.zipCode); secondCity = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100, \u0026#34;Lazio\u0026#34;); System.out.println(secondCity.zipCode); } Solution 1 20590 00100 0 20590 46100 "},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/env/sections/files/","title":"Hierarchical file system","section":"Development environment","content":" Hierarchical file system # Tree # Most operating system expose files as a tree (or possibly several trees for Windows).\nDefinition. A (nonempty) tree is either:\na single node (called a leaf), or a node with one or several children that are trees. In this tree, non-leaf nodes are directories, and the leaves can be files, executables, links, empty directories, etc. For instance:\n├── bin │ ├── echo │ └── ... ├── home │ ├── alice │ │ ├── .bashrc │ │ ├── .m2 │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── Desktop │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── music │ │ │ └── thatSong.mp3 │ │ └── workspace │ │ └── pp │ │ ├── assignments │ │ │ └── ... │ │ └── project │ │ ├── .git │ │ │ └── ... │ │ ├── src │ │ │ └── HelloWorld.java │ │ └── test │ │ └── testHelloWorld.java │ └── bob │ ├── .bashrc │ ├── Desktop │ │ └── ... │ └── music │ ├── thatSong.mp3 │ └── anotherSong.mp3 └── ... Terminology. In this course, we will use the terms \u0026ldquo;folder\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;directory\u0026rdquo; interchangeably. Terminology. \u0026ldquo;File\u0026rdquo; is sometimes used (e.g. in the Linux documentation) as a generic term for all nodes in this tree (in combination with \u0026ldquo;directory file\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;executable file\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;regular file\u0026rdquo;, etc.) We will not follow this terminology. Windows may expose several trees (e.g. one per physical device).\nPath # Definition. In such a tree, a path from a directory s to an arbitrary node t is either:\n. if s and t are the same node, or .. if t is the parent of s, or the name of t if s is the parent of t, or a path from s to some node i, followed by / (or \\on Windows), followed by a path from i to t. For instance (on macOS, Linux, etc.), in the tree above:\nhome/alice/workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is a path from the root to the file HelloWorld.java, workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is a path from the directory alice to the file HelloWorld.java, ../../bob/Desktop is a path from Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop, ../../bob/../bob/./Desktop is another path from Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop. Exercise How many paths are there from a directory to an arbitrary node? Solution (Countably) infinitely many. Warning. Some operating system (Windows, macOS) use case-insensitive paths, whereas others (Linux, Android) use case-sensitive paths (this may also vary depending on physical storage devices).\nFor instance, on Windows, src/HelloWorld.java and src/helloworld.java are the same path.\nIn order to make sure that your code is portable:\nalways use case-sensitive paths in your code (i.e. respect the names of your files, folders, executables, etc.), do not create two files (or subfolders, executables, etc.) in the same folder with identical names modulo upper/lower case (e.g. Readme.md and README.md). Convention. In what follows (unless explicitly stated), we will adopt by default the conventions for path names adopted on Linux. In particular, we will use / as a separator, and case-sensitive file and folder names. Absolute path # Definition. An absolute path is a path prefixed with:\n/ on macOS, Linux, Android, IOs, etc. a capital letter followed by :\\ on Windows, where the letter identifies a physical device, disk partition, etc. In particular, the identifier of the main partition is often the letter C, in which case absolute paths (within this partition) are prefixed with C:\\. An absolute path is always a path from the root of the tree.\nFor instance (on macOS, Linux, etc.), /home/alice/workspace/pp/project/src/HelloWorld.java is an absolute path to the file HelloWorld.java\nA few simple observations:\ntwo different files may share the same name (but cannot share an absolute path), and two files with the same name may or may not be identical. E.g. in the above example, the two files named thatSong.mp3 may or may not be identical. Relative path # Definition. A relative path is a path that is not absolute. For instance (on macOS, Linux, etc.), ../../bob/Desktop is a path to to Bob\u0026rsquo;s Desktop relative to Alice\u0026rsquo;s Desktop.\nNote that if p is a relative path, then p prefixed with ./ (or .\\ on Windows) is a path equivalent to p. This prefix is sometimes used to emphasize that a path is relative (among other purposes).\nWorking directory # Each process (e.g. a process that executes a Java program) has a working directory, which is a directory of the hierarchical file system. This directory may vary depending on the program and/or how it was started.\nMany programs (implicitly) interpret a relative path as relative to their working directory, regardless of whether the path is prefixed with ./ (or .\\ on Windows).\nIn particular, this is the case of:\nJava programs, file browsers, shells. Home directory # Each user of a system has its own home directory. E.g. in this example:\n/home/alice/ for Alice /home/bob/ for Bob Warning. The home directory is usually not the root of the tree (even if there is a single user on the machine). Absolute paths to the home directory # The home directory (of a regular user) is normally:\n/home/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on Linux/BSD, /Users/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on macOS, /User/\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on iOS, /data/media/⟨userId⟩ on Android, \u0026lt;mainHardDriveId\u0026gt;:\\Users\\\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt; on Windows (e.g. C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;userId\u0026gt;). On Linux and macOS, the alias ~ can be used as an absolute path to the current user\u0026rsquo;s home directory. For instance, in the above example, if Alice is logged in, then ~/music/thatSong.mp3 and /home/alice/music/thatSong.mp3 are two absolute paths to the same file.\nAccess restriction # Files and programs within the home directory of a user can usually be accessed by this user (or a system admin). Therefore programs that can be executed by all users are usually located in other directories (e.g. the program /bin/echo in the example above). Access restrictions (read, write and/or execute) may apply to the content of such directories. Notably, on Linux systems, (most of) the content of these directories can only be modified by a system admin.\nHidden files and directories # The home directory often contains files (resp. directories) whose names are preceded with a . (e.g. the file /home/alice/.bashrc in the above example). These are sometimes called \u0026ldquo;dot files\u0026rdquo; (resp. \u0026ldquo;dot folders\u0026rdquo;). On Linux and macOS, dot files and dot folder are hidden by default in a terminal or a file browser. On Windows, a (dot or not) file or folder can also be hidden, via a dedicated \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; attribute.\nHidden files and directories may be used to store (user-specific) parameters or options for a program. For instance, the configuration file ~/.gitconfig can be used to declare parameters (e.g. user identifier, etc.) or options (e.g. disable default fast-forward merge, etc.) to be used with git.\nHint. Configuration files are a convenient way to save your personal preferences and use them on several machines. For instance, you may need to logging to a remote server via ssh to perform some tasks (e.g. deploy a database or run costly computations). In such a scenario, you can upload dot files to your home directory on this server. Hidden files or directories may serve other purposes. For instance, the dot folder ~/.m2 is used by Maven to store (in one place) the Java libraries that are required (as dependencies) by any Java project present in the home directory.\nHidden files or directories may also contain information specific to a subdirectory. For instance, every git repository (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo;) contains a dot folder .git that stores the full history of modification made to the repository.\nUsage and layout # Your home directory is where you generally want to store your projects, documents, scripts, etc.\nYou are free to structure it as you like (using sub-directories). Make sure that this structure allows you to retrieve your own work easily.\nWarning. When you download or create a project/document in your home directory, choose its location. Do not:\nlet an application decide this location for you, rely exclusively on the \u0026ldquo;recently opened\u0026rdquo; feature of an app to locate your files, store files and project directly at the root of your home directory. Warning. Aside from a few exceptional cases, your home directory should not contain multiple copies of a project or document. Hint. It can be difficult for a new developer to figure out when to accept the default directory or layout suggested by a program, and when to overwrite it. As a (soft) rule of thumb, you generally want to choose the location of:\na file downloaded from your browser (or mail client), a project created with your IDE, a cloned git repository, a file created with an app, etc. Conversely, it is generally recommended to follow suggestions in the following cases:\ninternal structure of a project (typically the one generated by an IDE): e.g. the standard directory layout for a Maven project, or the standard directory structure of a Node JS project. software installed outside of your home directory, location of dot files and folders, etc. "},{"id":10,"href":"/docs/interfaces/sections/java_interfaces/","title":"Java interfaces","section":"Interfaces","content":" Java interfaces # A Java interface is a programming interface with additional (object-oriented) features.\nSyntactically, a Java interface is similar to a class. But (in its simplest form), it contains no code. Instead, it specifies the behavior of some methods (which are implemented in some classes).\nExamples # The implementation of our game contains an interface called Snapshot, which describes what a game snapshot is. This interface specifies (among others) a method called getSizeOfReinforcement, as follows:\npublic interface Snapshot { ... /** * Returns the number of units that will enter the board if reinforcement * is called for the input player. */ int getSizeOfReinforcement(Player player); ... } Note that this description contains no code.\nA Java interface acts not only as documentation, but also as a contract : any (non-abstract) class that implements this interface must implement all methods declared in the interface (otherwise the program will not compile).\nA Java interface can be used to specify how two components of a system communicate (before the interface is even implemented!). For instance, the Snapshot interface specifies which information must be provided by our backend to the component in charge of displaying the game on screen.\nThe name of an interface can be used as a reference type (similarly to the name of a class). For instance, the Snapshot interface also specifies a method\nBoard getBoard(); which must return an object of type Board. And Board is itself an interface, which specifies the information needed to draw the game board (units, position, etc).\nHere is for instance a fragment of the Board interface:\n/** * Board for an ongoing game. * This is a two-dimensional grid. * * Tile coordinates are natural numbers and start at 0. * The top left tile has coordinates (0,0). */ public interface Board { ... /** * Returns true if the input coordinates are within the board\u0026#39;s boundaries */ boolean areValidCoordinates(int rowIndex, int columnIndex); /** * Removes the unit standing at the input coordinates, and does nothing * if there is none. */ void removeUnit(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) throws CoordinatesOutOfBoardException; ... } Finally, the interface DisplayManager specifies a method that can be called (e.g. from the backend) to draw a Snapshot on screen (together with a message):\npublic interface DisplayManager { ... /** * Displays the input snapshot on screen, as well as the input message. */ void drawSnapshot(Snapshot snapshot, String message); ... } Observe that these interfaces only specify what classes should implement, not how. In other words, these interfaces specify how components can communicate without exposing unnecessary implementation details.\nWhen to use a Java interface? # Technically, Java interfaces are not needed in a project. But they can make collaboration within a team of developers significantly easier. In particular:\nAn interface is a convenient way to expose what is needed to interact with your code, while hiding the details of your implementation. For instance, the method drawSnapshot (mentioned above) can be called to draw a snapshot on screen, without knowing how this method is implemented.\nAs a contract, an interface allows two programmers to work independently, ensuring interoperability between the methods and/or components that they are respectively developing.\nInheritance # An interface in Java can extend another interface, like a class can extend another class, with the same keyword extends.\nHowever, Java interfaces support multiple inheritance (whereas java classes do not). This means that an interface A can extend two interfaces B and C even if B and C do not extend each other.\nImplementing an interface # In Java, the keyword implements is used to indicate that a class implements an interface. For instance:\npublic class SnapshotImpl implements Snapshot { ... } Note. It is good practice to avoid a class and an interface with the same name (even if they describe the same objects). To differentiate them, you may for instance use the suffix Impl, as illustrated above. Consider a class C that implements an interface I :\nif C is abstract, then it can implement some of the methods declared in I if C is not abstract, then each method declared in I must be implemented in C (or some superclass of C ), otherwise the program will not compile. Exercise The program represented by the following diagram does not compile. Can you see why?\nSolution The class Butterfly does not implement the method sleep.\nNote. In this example, the class Butterfly inherits an implementation of boost (from AbstractUnit), and overrides it. This is not an error.\nSince Java interfaces support multiple inheritance, a Java class can implement several interface that do not extend each other.\nFor instance, the class Unicorn could implement an interface Animal and another interface ImaginaryCreature, even though none of these two interfaces extends the other (not all animals are imaginary, and not all imaginary creatures are animals). This would be declared as follows:\npublic class Unicorn extends MobileUnit implements Animal, ImaginaryCreature { ... } Exercise The program represented by the following diagram does not compile. Can you see why?\nSolution The class Unicorn does not implement the method hide. Interfaces vs abstract classes # In theory, Java\u0026rsquo;s interfaces and abstract classes serve different purposes:\nabstract classes are meant to factorize code (i.e. avoid redundant code), whereas interfaces are meant to document code and act as a contract. However, in practice, they have partially overlapping features, which may be confusing.\nIn particular:\nan abstract class can have abstract methods, which behave similarly to interface methods (with the additional constraint that an abstract method must be implemented by at least one subclass). Since Java 8 (2014), interfaces can carry code, in so-called default methods. This feature was introduced for backward compatibility reasons, but arguably contradicts the meaning of the term \u0026ldquo;interface\u0026rdquo;. An benefit of default methods (i.e. methods implemented in interfaces) is that they allow multiple inheritance of implemented methods (since interfaces allow multiple inheritance), which is not possible with classes. For this reason, some authors (like Joshua Bloch) recommend using default methods instead of abstract methods. However, a program where interfaces play the role of abstract classes may be confusing for less experienced Java developers.\nFor this course, we chose to present Java interfaces from a more traditional (pre-Java 8) perspective, because this perspective is arguably easier to understand, and because this is still the dominant usage of Java interfaces. However, for your project, feel free to deviate from this model if you think that this is appropriate (in particular if you need multiple inheritance).\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/docs/project/sections/board_game/","title":"Option 2: board game","section":"Project","content":" Option 2: board game # The second project option available to you consists in developing a video game with mechanics analogous to the ones of Might \u0026amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes or Legend of Solgard.\nIf you choose this option, you will be provided:\na basic graphical user interface (GUI) that you can reuse and/or customize, examples during lectures that you may adapt to your project. Requirements # The minimal requirement to submit your project is a player vs player game playable on a single machine.\nBut of course, you are free to go further and add your own features. Among other possibilities, you could for instance:\nimplement new mechanics (e.g. a rock-paper-scissor logic for unit encounters, events that may affect the board, etc.), make the game deterministic (i.e. eliminate randomness), create units with specific behaviors, implements scripted encounters (\u0026ldquo;boss fights\u0026rdquo;), implement a story, character progression, etc., develop a player vs bot mode, etc, Note. If you choose the last options in the list above (player vs bot), then you may benefit from an algorithm seen in the chapter on recursion. Besides, if several groups choose this option, we may organize a competition between bots (provided that they play by the same rules). Guidelines # GUI # The source code for the GUI can be cloned from GitHub. The project is designed so that:\nyou can develop a fully functional game (player vs player or player vs bot) by focusing exclusively on the backend (i.e. the mechanics of the game), without modifying the GUI. backend and frontend are decoupled. Communication between frontend and backend is specified via Java interfaces. It revolves around the notion of a game snapshot, which contains all the information needed to describe a state of the game (equivalently, you can think of a snapshot as a save state). In particular, snapshots are independent of a specific GUI.\nFor instance, a method is available that allows you to pass a snapshot to the GUI component. When you call this method, the snapshot will be drawn on screen, replacing the previous one (if any).\nAs input, your code receives the next action of the active player (for instance, delete the unit present on a specific tile). These are again specified by an interface. Your code should react accordingly: modify the current snapshot, and then send it the GUI component for display.\nThe README.md file (at the root of the project) contains a description of the different components and interfaces, as well as building instructions, and explains where your code could fit. Read it carefully before you start working on your project!\nNote. You are of course free to modify the interfaces that come with the project. But this may require modifying the implementation of the GUI. Disclaimer. By design, the project compromises performance for simplicity and modularity.

Note. If a git repository is a subfolder of another git repository, then the inner repository is not included in the history of the outer one. Limitation. Git is not suited to large volumes of data (more than 1 GB in the same repository). This is usually not an issue for your own work (code, notes, reports, etc.) as a student in computer science.

In this case, A is called a subclass of B. The intuitive meaning is inclusion between their respective sets of instances, i.e. every instance of A is also an instance of B (but the converse may not hold).\nThis can be paraphrased in English by \u0026ldquo;every A is a B \u0026ldquo;. For instance:\nevery banana is a fruit every square is a rectangle every rectangle is a geometric shape, etc. Transitivity # The \u0026ldquo;extend\u0026rdquo; relation is transitive, meaning that if A extends B and B extends C, then A extends C (for any classes A, B and C ). For instance, from the above examples, one can infer that \u0026ldquo;every square is a geometric shape\u0026rdquo;.\nInheritance # Naturally, if A is a subclass of B then it inherits the properties of B. For instance, a rectangle has four right angles. Since every square is a rectangle, a square has four right angles as well.\nFactorizing code with a (possibly abstract) superclass # Inheritance can be used to avoid redundant code\nDirect inheritance: illustration # Let us model the units of our game as objects.\nEach unit has:\na type (e.g. mage, unicorn, etc.), a color (at least in the original game), and a certain amount of health. The behavior and stats of a unit (e.g number of turns before attacking when combined, default health, etc.) are dictated by its type. So it makes sense to group units by type.\nFor instance, one can create a class Unicorn whose instances are all units of type unicorn. In Java:\npublic class Unicorn { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unicorn(String color) { this.color = color; health = 1; attackCountdown = -1; } } Note. We used the keyword attackCountdown in this example to indicate the number of turns before the unit attacks (and a special value of -1 when it is not set to attack). But there are of course other ways to model this. Note. In this example, we used the prefix this. for the attribute color only, because there is no ambiguity for the three other attributes. We can also create a class Butterfly on the same model\npublic class Butterfly { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Butterfly(String color) { this.color = color; health = 2; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Now consider a method encounter that manages an encounter between two units. Without inheritance, one would need to implement four versions of this method:\nunicorn vs unicorn, unicorn vs butterfly, butterfly vs unicorn, and butterfly vs butterfly. For instance, the first of these four methods could be implemented as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unicorn u1, Unicorn u2) { // save the initial value of the first unit\u0026#39;s health int copy = u1.health; u1.health -= u2.health; u2.health -= copy; } More generally, if the game has \\(n\\) types of units, then the code will contain \\(n^2\\) nearly identical encounter methods.\nQuestion. Can we use inheritance in this example to avoid duplicate code (and how)? Observe that a unicorn and a butterfly (viewed as object) have identical attributes (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo;), namely String color, int health, and int attackCountdown. So we can create a superclass of UnicornandButterflythat carries these attributes, and let the two subclasses inherit it. For instance, this superclass may be called Unit.\nHowever, we may also want every unit in the game to have a concrete type (like \u0026ldquo;unicorn\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;butterfly\u0026rdquo;), rather than being a generic \u0026ldquo;unit\u0026rdquo;. In Java, this can be achieved with the abstract keyword. This keyword ensures that our superclass cannot be directly instantiated (even though it can still have a constructor). For instance:\npublic abstract class Unit { String color; int health; int attackCountdown; public Unit(String color, int health) { this.color = color; this.health = health; int attackCountdown = -1; } } Because this class is abstract, the following code will not compile:\nUnit myUnit = new Unit(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, 2); Next, we can declare that Unicorn extends Unit, by using the Java keyword extends. We can also use the constructor of Unit within the constructor of Unicorn, with the Java keyword super.\nNote. In Java (as opposed to C++ for instance), a class can only have one immediate superclass, so the keyword super is never ambiguous. This yields:\npublic class Unicorn extends Unit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } And we can proceed similarly for the class Butterfly.\nObserve that all the attributes are now carried by the superclass Unit. However, because they are inherited, these attributes can be accessed as if they were regular attributes of the subclass. For instance,\nUnicorn myUnit = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); System.out.println(myUnit.health); outputs\n1 This allows us to write a generic encounter method, as follows:\nvoid encounter(Unit u1, Unit u2) { // save the initial value of the first unit\u0026#39;s health int copy = u1.health; u1.health -= u2.health; u2.health -= copy; } And this method can be used with unicorns and/or butterflies. For instance:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;); encounter(myUnicorn, myButterfly); } Transitive inheritance # In the example above, we assumed that all units have a color and can attack. What if we also want to create a type of unit called Wall that has no color and cannot attack? An instance of this class does not need the attributes color and attackCountdown.\nA quick solution here consists is setting attackCountdown to -1, and color to null. However, unnecessary attributes make code harder to understand, and such a design may not scale well if the game is extended with more units types.\nExercise Modify our model to accommodate for the class Wall, so that an instance of Wall only has the health attribute. Possible solution One solution (among others) is the following:\nmodify the class Unit so that it only carries the attribute health, Wall extends Unit, create an (abstract) subclass of Unit (for instance MobileUnit) that carries the other two attributes, Butterfly and Unicorn extend MobileUnit (therefore they also extend Unit, by transitivity). Or in Java:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; public Unit(int health) { this.heath = health; } } public class Wall extends Unit { public Wall() { super(5); } } public abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { String color; int attackCountdown; public MobileUnit(String color, int health) { super(health); this.color = color; this.attackCountdown = -1; } } public class Unicorn extends MobileUnit { public Unicorn(String color) { super(color, 1); } } and similarly for Butterfy.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/objects/","title":"Objects and classes","section":"Docs","content":" Objects and classes # This chapter introduces some basic notions of (class-based) object-oriented programming.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/intro/sections/content/","title":"Content","section":"This course","content":" Content of the course # This is a beginner\u0026rsquo;s course on imperative and (class-based) object oriented programming, with an emphasis on practice and collaboration.\nThe course relies on Java as main programming language.

The object referenced by the variable is accessible in the method, as well as its attributes.\nThis intuitively allows us to write methods with one less argument. For instance, consider the following method, which is not and instance method. It verifies whether two instance of MobileUnit have the same color:\npublic boolean sameColor(MobileUnit u1, MobileUnit u2){ return u1.color.equals(u2.color); } This method may be called as follows:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); boolean sameColor = sameColor(myUnicorn, myButterfly); Instead, one may write an equivalent method, as an instance method of our class MobileUnit, with one less argument:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { String color; ... public boolean sameColorAs(MobileUnit otherUnit){ return color.equals(otherUnit.color); } } and we can call this method as follows:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Butterfly myButterfly = new Butterfly(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); boolean sameColor = myUnicorn.sameColorAs(myButterfly); } Overriding # A same instance method can be declared in a class C and a subclass S or C. In this case, we say that S overrides the method.\nWhen such a method is called, the most specific applicable version is executed.\nFor instance, let us extend our example from the previous section with a method regen, declared in both Unit and MobileUnit, as follows:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; ... public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } } } public abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } health += 1; } } Now consider this program.\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); myUnicorn.regen(); This program increases the health of (the object referenced by) myUnicorn by 2, because Unicorn is a subclass of MobileUnit. However, the following program increases the health of (the object referenced by) myWall by 1, because Wall is a subclass of Unit, but not a subclass of MobileUnit.\nWall myWall = new Wall(); myWall.regen(); Hint. In Java, you can use the annotation @Override to indicate that a method overrides another, as follows:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... @Override public void regen(){ if(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } health += 1; } } This is not necessary. The benefit is that the program will not compile if the overridden and overriding methods have different signatures.\nMore generally, syntactic mistakes (a.k.a. compile time errors) are easier to fix than bugs (a.k.a. runtime errors). So when possible, it is good practice to use features of a language that prevent compilation if incorrect programs. This is why debugging in an untyped language (like Python, Javascript, Lua, etc.) can be more difficult than in a typed one (such as Java, C#, Typescript, etc.).\nDynamic dispatch (a.k.a. runtime polymorphism) # Dynamic dispatch consists in determining which version of a method must be called when a program is executed (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;at run time\u0026rdquo;), when this cannot be determined by analyzing the program alone. This is a feature of most (class-based) object-oriented languages. For instance, in our example, assume a method generateRandomUnits that generates a random array of units (butterflies, unicorns or walls). And let us call the method regen for each unit in this array:\nUnit[] ramdomUnits = generateRandomUnits(); for (Unit unit: randomUnits){ unit.regen(); } The most specific applicable version of the method regen will be executed for each unit, based on its type, even though this type cannot be determined at compile time. For instance, if there is an instance of Unicorn in this array, then the method MobileUnit.regen() will be executed for this instance (rather than the method Unit.regen()).\nCode factorization # An overriding method often extends the functionality of the overridden one. This is a possible source of duplicate code. For instance, in the example above, both implementations of regen() contain:\nif(health \u0026lt; 10){ health += 1; } A common way to factorize this consists in calling the overridden method inside the overriding one. In Java, the keyword super allows us to distinguish the two methods (since they have the same name). For instance, in the above example, the overriding method may be better written as follows:\npublic abstract class MobileUnit extends Unit { ... public void regen() { super.regen(); health += 1; } } Exercise In this example, what would be the effect of replacing super.regen() with regen()? Solution The method would not terminate. Exercise Consider the method encounter of the previous section. Add it as an instance method to our example, so that:\nthe method now distinguishes the attacker from the defender, a wall cannot attack, a unicorn gets a regen if it defends. Possible solution The trick here consists in viewing an encounter from the point of view of the defender:\npublic abstract class Unit { int health; ... public void defend(MobileUnit attacker) { // save the initial value of the first unit\u0026#39;s health int copy = health; health -= attacker.health; attacker.health -= copy; } } public class Unicorn extends Unit { ... public void defend(MobileUnit attacker) { regen(); super.defend(attacker); } } "},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/interfaces/","title":"Interfaces","section":"Docs","content":" Interfaces # The term interface is used to refer to a variety of artifacts.

For instance:\nif Alice sends a message to Bob, then she has to use a language that Bob can understand, if Alice uses git via command-line, then she has to use a command that git recognizes as a possible input, if a program calls git, then it also has to use a command that git recognizes as a possible input, etc. Warning.

So when two programs communicate, they may use different interfaces, one in each direction (a rough analogy could be communication between a human being and a dog). "},{"id":23,"href":"/docs/env/sections/install/","title":"Software management","section":"Development environment","content":" Software management # Dependencies # As a developer, you frequently need to download, install and/or update:\nlibraries used in your projects (called dependencies), core programming utilities, such as a compiler or interpreter for a given programming language, a package manager, etc. tools for software development: editor, debugger, visualization tool, etc. These programs have their own dependencies, that have their own dependencies, etc. And two programs may depend on different versions of a same third program.\nDependency management is a frequent source of complications during software development. Dependency patterns that may occur include:\nco-dependencies:\nFor instance, consider the following configuration:\nProject \\(P\\) depends on a certain version of Library \\(L_1\\) , \\(P\\) also depends on Library \\(L_2\\) , which depends on an older version of \\(L_1\\) (and the two versions are not compatible), The build of project \\(P\\) may fail because it can contain only one version of \\(L_1\\) .\ncyclic dependencies:\nLibrary \\(L_1\\) depends on a specific version of Library \\(L_2\\) , and\n\\(L_2\\) depends on a specific version of \\(L_1\\) .\nUpgrading one of these two libraries independently may prevent the other one to run. But it may be possible to upgrade both at the same time.\netc.\nNote that in these two examples, dependencies may be direct or transitive. As a result, it can be very difficult to diagnose such problems.\nThe term dependency hell is sometimes used to refer to such situations.\nTwo (non-exclusive) broad approaches are commonly adopted to avoid such issues:\nautomated dependency management, and self-containment: avoid shared libraries, each program having a copy (some of) its own dependencies. Automated dependency management # Definitions # A package is a program together with some metadata. These metadata include the program\u0026rsquo;s name, version, release date, authors, licence and dependencies (together with their versions).\nA software repository is a collection of packages that comply to the same format of metadata. A software repository (precisely, multiple copies of it) is generally hosted on the cloud.\nA package manager automates the installation (as well as configuration, update and removal) of packages from a software repository (or several) to a user\u0026rsquo;s machine.\nExamples # Many programming languages have dedicated package managers. For instance:\nMaven for Java, npm for Node.js (Javascript) pip for Python, NuGet for .NET (C#, F#, and Visual Basic) RubyGems for Ruby, CPAN for Perl CRAN for R, etc. Some applications also have dedicated software repositories for plugins (and plugin managers to handle these plugins). For instance.\nThe VSCode market place, CTAN for LateX, MELPA for Emacs, etc. Other applications (such as zsh, vim or neovim) only have plugin managers, without a centralized software repository. These managers install plugins directly from hosts (e.g. a GitHub repository) specified by the plugins\u0026rsquo; authors.\nLast (but not least), an operating system (OS) may use a package manager and software repositories. Notably, this is the preferred way of installing software on most Linux distributions. Widely used OS package managers include:\napt for Debian and derivatives, dnf for Fedora and derivatives, pacman for Arch and derivatives, homebrew for macOS, chocolatey (since 2011) and winget (since May 2021) for Windows. Usage # Installing, updating and removing software via a package manager is highly recommended in most scenarios. In particular:\ndependencies of a package are also installed (or it some cases updated or removed) transitively, some package managers can install and manage several versions of the same package (when needed), the installation process often uses a default configuration and directory layout (environment variables, etc.) that facilitates interaction with other programs. The installation (or update or removal) procedure is also significantly simpler, thus leaving less room for manual errors. As an illustration, here is the full procedure to install Maven with the apt package manager (on Debian and derivatives):\napt install maven and similarly with homebrew (on macOS):\nbrew install maven or with Chocolatey (on Windows):\nchoco install maven In comparison, the procedure to install Maven manually on Windows is more involved, thus more likely to introduce errors (trough inadvertence, or by following outdated instructions).\nHowever, in some (rare) scenarios, a manual installation may be preferred. In particular when the latest version of a program is needed, but not available yet on the software repository.\nSelf-containment # A variety of strategies can be adopted to build a program so that it runs in partial isolation from the rest of the system that it is deployed on (i.e. in its own environment, and with its own dependencies, that cannot be used by other programs).\nFor instance, a Node.js project often includes a copy of all the Javascript libraries that it depends on (transitively). Further self-containment strategies may involve different levels of virtualization (e.g. via Docker).\nThis is one way of avoiding shared dependencies. Other benefits are increased portability, and ease of installation by end-users. Drawbacks include and increased workload on the developer\u0026rsquo;s side (e.g. for maintenance), and limited opportunities for integration with other programs.\nSelf-containment in Java # In Java, self-containment is usually less pronounced during development. Java libraries are typically managed via Maven:\non a per-user basis (which can be viewed as a compromise between per-project and system-wise): each user has a hidden folder \u0026lt;homeDir\u0026gt;/.m2/ that contains all Java libraries used in his/her projects, and allowing multiple versions of the same library to coexist. However, a Java application that targets non-developers can be released together with its Java dependencies, as a so-called über jar (a.k.a. fat jar).\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/docs/git/sections/commit/","title":"Add, commit, stash","section":"git","content":" Add, commit, stash # Staging files # Git lets you to choose which modifications will be part of your next commit.\nFirst, run\ngit status This will show which files have been added or modified since the last commit on the current branch (if any).

For this course, you do not need to perform any transaction. Advantages.\nAnimations can be sped up. The touch-screen interface is more modern than the one of MMCoH for Android and iOS. Drawbacks.\nProgression is based on a (complex) system of virtual currencies, which may add noise to the interface. The game can only be played (for free) a limited amount of time per day (approximately 45 min). The default mode is not the (symmetric) 2 players mode that we will work on (it requires more playtime to be unlocked). So you will need an extra effort of imagination. "},{"id":26,"href":"/docs/objects/sections/tostring/","title":"Displaying objects","section":"Objects and classes","content":" Displaying objects # The class Object # Java has a native class called Object with 11 instance methods. Every Java class implicitly extends Object, including user-defined classes. Therefore any Java class inherits these methods. toString # toString is one of the methods of the class Object. Here is (part of) its specification:\n/** Returns a string representation of the object. * In general, the toString method returns a string that * \u0026#34;textually represents\u0026#34; this object. */ public String toString(); This is the preferred way to display information about an object. For instance, the debugger of your IDE probably relies on this method to display a string that represents an object.\nThis method is also called by many (native or not) methods and operators. For instance, the following program\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); System.out.println(myUnicorn); String message = \u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34; + myUnicorn; is equivalent to\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); System.out.println(myUnicorn.toString()); String message = \u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34; + myUnicorn.toString(); Overriding toString # The default implementation of toString (in the class Object) displays very little information about the object:\npublic String toString() { return getClass().getName() + \u0026#34;@\u0026#34; + Integer.toHexString(hashCode()); } Warning. The output of hashCode() in this example is not the reference (a.k.a. \u0026ldquo;memory address\u0026rdquo;) of the object. So a common practice consists in overriding toString. For instance, here is a possible implementation of the method toString within a class Unicorn:\npublic class Unicorn { String color; int health; @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Unicorn{\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;color=\u0026#34; + color + \u0026#34;, \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;health=\u0026#34; + health + \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } } Hint. Your IDE can generate such a method. Recursion # A naive implementation of toString (e.g. generated by an IDE) may have unexpected effects.\nExercise Consider an implementation of our game where units (on each side of the board) are grouped by column. This implementation may use a class Column to represent a column and the adjacent one(s), as follows:\npublic class Column { Unit[] units; // null if this is the left-most column Column leftAdjacentColumn; // null if this is the right-most column Column rightAdjacentColumn; public Column(Unit[] units){ this.units = units; } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Column{\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;left=\u0026#34; + leftAdjacentColumn +\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;right=\u0026#34; + rightAdjacentColumn +\u0026#34;, \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;units=\u0026#34; + units + \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } } Then a board may be created as follows:\nUnit[] a1 = new Unit[]{ new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;) }; Column c1 = new Column(a1); Unit[] a2 = new Unit[]{ new Butterfly(\u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;) }; Column c2 = new Column(a2); c1.rightAdjacentColumn = c2; c2.leftAdjacentColumn = c1; System.out.println(c1); There is an issue with this program. Can you identify it?\nSolution The program does not terminate, because toString is (implicitly) recursive, and each of the two columns refers to the other. "},{"id":27,"href":"/docs/env/sections/os/","title":"Operating system","section":"Development environment","content":" Operating system (OS) # Your computer does not bind you to one OS. You can run multiple OSs on the same computer by:\npartitioning your disk, or booting from an external drive, or using virtualisation. Depending on what you are developing, one operating system may be more convenient than another.\nWe review below some of the benefits and drawbacks of developing under Windows, macOS and Linux.\nWindows # Benefits and drawbacks # Here are some benefits of using Windows as your OS for software development:\nit comes pre-installed on most PCs, it is compatible out-of-the-box with most hardware, it provides a fully integrated development suite for the .NET framework (C#, F#, Visual Basic), and to a lesser extent C/C++. And some drawbacks:\nfor general-purpose development, Windows is not friendly to new programmers (compared to Linux or macOS), the usage of an (OS-wise) package manager is (still) not the norm, it sometimes favors backwards compatibility over compliance with modern standards. When to use Windows (and when not) # Windows is the OS of choice for developing software meant to run on Windows only, or cross-platform software written in one of the .NET languages (mostly C#). C# is notably used for game development (e.g. for Unity) and graphical interfaces (although Javascript-based graphical frameworks may have become more popular lately). Another interesting feature of C# (compared to Java) is the Language Integrated Query framework, which provides a tight integration with database engines.\nVisual studio (not VSCode!) offers a fully integrated development suite for the .NET languages, and is also commonly used for C/C++.\nFor other programming languages, using Windows may require extra efforts or precautions (compared to Linux or macOS), especially for new developers.\nIn particular, manual software installation/upgrade/removal can be complex and error-prone. Writing scripts (e.g. for two programs to interact) can also be more involved, especially given the fact that Windows has three shells (the Windows shell, the Windows Power Shell and Power Shell), or four if counting WSL.\nBesides, additional care must be taken to write platform-independent code. Here are for instance two frequent sources of errors made by students:\nPath names: Windows uses \\ as a path separator, as opposed to the / used by other OSs (or in web URIs). In Java, a path can be safely written with /. At run time (i.e. when the program is executed), this symbol will be interpreted based on the underlying OS (i.e. as \\ on Windows, and as / on other OSs). However, a path written with \\ will be interpreted as such (therefore the program will throw an exception on OSs other than Windows). Line breaks: many text editors for Windows encode a line break as two ascii characters (\\r\\n), against a single character (\\n) on most modern systems. This is often transparent for regular users, because many text editors (or even git) use detection and normalization procedures for line breaks. However, this may be a source of bugs for developers, for instance when generating code, or when writing a script to configure a virtual environment (e.g. a Docker image). For this course # You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using Windows (even if your collaborators use other OSs).\nHowever, you may need to pay extra attention, for instance to path names (as explained above). Installing and configuring the necessary software may also be more complex (again, we recommend using a package manager when possible).\nIf you do not manage to set up your working environment for this course (see the requirements) in a short amount of time, then consider using a Linux distribution instead (see the dedicated section below for using Linux alongside Windows).\nmacOS # Here are some benefits of using macOS as your OS for software development:\nit comes pre-installed with an Apple computer, it is POSIX-compliant (since 2001), thus offering easier interoperability with Linux/BSD/Android/IOS the homebrew package manager is relatively mature. And some drawbacks:\nsome software may not be available, your working environment is not easily customizable. When to use macOS (and when not) # MacOS is rarely used on hardware other than Apple computers.\nIt is often a good choice for new developers. In particular, homebrew offers an easy way to install programs needed for general-purpose development (compilers, interpreters, other package managers, etc.), and its software repository is reasonably comprehensive in that regard (albeit smaller than repositories used by Linux distributions).\nA number of more experienced developers also work with macOS, notably for web development (Node.js/Javascript) or data science related projects (Python).\nA Linux distribution may be more convenient in some situations, e.g. when developing a program meant to run on a server, or when working with Docker containers.\nFor this course # If you have a Apple laptop, then you should not need an OS other than macOS for this course (even if your collaborators use other OSs).\nLinux # Here are some benefits of using Linux as your OS for software development:\nit is used by most web servers servers, it is relatively lightweight, for developers, it has an important (and high-quality) online community support, (OS) package managers are mature and easy to use, your working environment can be easily customized and/or configured. And some drawbacks:\nLinux rarely comes pre-installed on a computer, there sometimes too much choice of programs or distributions, Linux distributions are (still) not as friendly to desktop users as Windows or macOS, Hardware support (e.g. for peripherals) is (still) more limited than for Windows. When to use Linux (and when not) # Linux is often the OS of choice for developing programs meant to run on web servers. It is also a good choice for writing cross-platform software.\nLinux (together with macOS) is also a good environment to learn the basics of programming, due to native compatibility with a wide range of technologies for general-purpose development (e.g. Docker). Software installation, configuration, upgrade and removal is also made easier by mature package managers. Besides, the Linux shell is a versatile yet relatively simple tool that can ease process management or interaction between programs.\nLinux is arguably not the best choice for developing Desktop applications that target a specific OS (such as Windows or macOS), or in some specific domains such as game development.\nFor this course # You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using a Linux distribution (even if your collaborators use other OSs).\nIn particular, if you face important issues when setting up your working environment (git, JDK, Maven, Gradle, etc. ) on Windows, we recommend using a Linux distribution instead (because it may save you time). Keep in mind however that this will not solve issues related to the configuration of your IDE.\nNot that you can use Linux (for development) and Windows (for other purposes) on the same computer.\nWhich distribution to choose # You can use any (reasonably mainstream) all-purposes Linux distribution for this course (and other courses).\nThe choice may seem overwhelming at first sight, but most distributions are forks of a few popular ones (Debian, Fedora, Arch, \u0026hellip;), and are relatively similar to each other. Besides, Linux environments are highly customizable: for instance, the choice of a distribution does not bind you to its default desktop environment. Available software is also very similar from one distribution to another: regardless of the distribution, you will have access to openJDK, git, Maven, etc. via a package manager.\nDistributions that are more desktop-oriented can be more friendly to newcomers (especially non-developers), but also come with unnecessary software. Two popular distributions in this category (for new users) are Linux Mint and Zorin OS. Both are forks of Ubuntu, which is itself a fork of Debian.\nFor a (slightly) more lightweight distribution, MX Linux is currently a popular choice. It is also based on Debian.\nHow to install a Linux distribution # Most distributions provide detailed instructions on their web page.\nRegardless of the distribution, you have are (at least) three possible options:\nVirtual machine (such as VirtualBox). This is the simplest option in terms of installation. But also the most expensive computationally, so only suited to a relatively powerful computer. Performance is also suboptimal.\nA virtual machine is often good way to test a distribution before properly installing it.\nBootable drive. You can store your Linux distribution on an external hard drive, and boot on Linux when the hard drive is connected to your computer. Compared to the third option below, this may affect the performance of disk access.\nPartition (with dual boot). You can dedicate a certain amount of space to a Linux distribution your hard drive. A minimum of 30 GB is often recommended, but this can be adjusted later on. When starting your computer, it will let you choose which OS to boot on. This is the best option in terms of performance.\nNote. For the third option (dual boot), the installation procedure has become more involved on some recent computers, due to encrypted disks or so-called \u0026ldquo;secure boot\u0026rdquo;. So make sure that the instructions that you follow are up-to-date.

Upcast # Explicit upcasts are uncommon, but may still be useful in some scenarios, e.g. to disambiguate two method calls.\nImplicit upcasts on the other hand are very frequent, when the type of an object cannot be determined at compile time.\nExample. Consider the following classes:\nNow consider the following program, where the method getUnits produces an array of units that depends on the player\u0026rsquo;s input. The type of objects in this array (Unicorn or Butterfly) cannot be determined at compile time. Thanks to the implicit upcast, they can nonetheless be treated as (underspecified) units.\nUnit[] units = getUnits(); for (Unit unit: units){ System.out.println(unit.health); } Downcast # Downcasting in Java is frequent for objects whose type cannot be determined at compile time. However, this may not be safe. For instance, in the above example, downcasting a unit from Unit to Unicorn may cause a ClassCastException (at runtime), because this unit is a instance of Butterfly. This is why downcasting is often used in combination with the instanceof operator. For instance the above example can be modifed as follows:\nUnit[] units = getUnits(); for (Unit unit: units){ if(unit instanceof Unicorn){ ((Unicorn) unit).regen(); } } Here the operation (Unicorn) unit is a downcast. The output of this operation has type Unicorn, thus allowing the call to the method regen.\nObject equality # As we saw in a previous chapter, a constructor in Java creates an object in memory and returns a (fresh) reference to that object. Since two objects have different locations in memory, their respective references must differ, even if the objects are identical.\nExample. Consider (a simplified version of) the class City that we saw earlier.\npublic class City { String name; int zipCode; public City(String name, int zipCode){ this.name = name; this.zipCode = zipcode; } } The following program will output false:\nCity city1 = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); City city2 = new City(\u0026#34;Florence\u0026#34;, 50100); System.out.println(city1 == city2); However, in some scenarios, it may be useful to compare the objects themselves, rather than their references. Java provides a native method called equals for this purpose.\nLike the method toString that we saw earlier, the equals is an instance method of the native Java class Object, which is an (implicit) superclass of every other class. So every (user-defined of native) class inherits equals.\nHere is the source code of Object.equals:\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) { return (this == obj); } In other words, by default, this method behaves like the == operator. In order to use this method to check whether two objects are equal, it has to be overriden.\nFor instance, here is a prototypical implementation of the method equals within our class City:\n@Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (this == o) { // same reference return true; } if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; // o is null or has a different type } City downcastObject = (City) o; return zipCode == downcastObject.zipCode \u0026amp;\u0026amp; name.equals(downcastObject.name); } Hint. Your IDE can generate such a method. Note in this example:\nthe (safe) downcast from Object to City, and the recursive call to equals (because String is not a primitive type). Recursion # Warning. Similarly to what we saw with the method toString, beware of naive (recursive) implementations of equals if your program can create an object that refers to itself (directly or indirectly). Built-in implementations # Several native Java classes have their own implementation of equals. We will encounter several of them during this course, notably for the class String and for the implementations of the interface Set.\nhashCode # The method equals is usually overridden together with another method of the class Object, called hashCode. In particular, this is needed for the method equals of the class HashSet to behave correctly.

These are often called static attributes (or sometimes class attributes or class variables), as opposed to the attributes that we have seen so far, called instance attributes (or member variables). Static attributes are marked with the keyword static.\nExample. Consider a version of our game where characteristics for each unit type (e.g. default health, etc.) can be declared manually, in a text file. The path to this file could be stored as a static attribute, as follows:\npublic class Unicorn { static String configFile = \u0026#34;units/unicorn.txt\u0026#34;; int health; public Unicorn(){ health = getHealthFromConfigFile(configFile); } public regen(){ health++; } } Each instance of Unicorn carries its own value for the attribute health. But the value of configFile is unique.\nFor instance, the following program creates in memory a unique string for configFile, which is carried by the class.\nUnicorn u1 = new Unicorn(); Unicorn u2 = new Unicorn(); Static methods # Similarly to a static attribute, a static method does not depend on a specific object, as opposed to an instance method. Example (continued).\nWe can add to our class Unicorn a static method that checks whether the configuration file exists:\npublic class Unicorn{ ... static boolean configFileExists() { return Files.exists(Paths.get(configFile)); } } (note that the method getHealthFromConfigFile also may also be static, if its execution is identical for all instances of Unicorn).\nRemember that an instance method can be called outside of the class where it is declared, using an instance of the class followed by .:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); myUnicorn.regen(); A static method can (syntactically) be called in the same way, for instance:\nUnicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); boolean valid = myUnicorn.configFileExists(); However, this is often discouraged, because this syntax can be misleading (in this example, configFileExists can be mistaken for an instance method).\nAlternatively, since the method depends on the class (rather than an instance), the call can be prefixed with the class name. This syntax is often preferred, because it leaves no ambiguity. For instance:\nboolean valid = Unicorn.configFileExists(); Note that there may be several instances of a same class in memory during the execution of a program, or no instance at all. This is why a static method cannot reference an instance method or attribute. For instance, adding the following static method to our class would cause a compilation error, because health is an instance attribute.\npublic class Unicorn { static void reduceHealth(){ health--; } } Inheritance # Two static methods with the same name and signature can be declared in a class and a superclass. In Java\u0026rsquo;s terminology, this is not called method overriding, but instead method hiding. An important difference is that dynamic dispatch (a.k.a. runtime polymorphism) does not apply to this case (the method to be called is determined at compile time, rather than run time).\nExample (continued).\nLet us extend our example with a subclass of Unicorn that hides the static method configFileExists.\npublic class EvilUnicorn extends Unicorn { static boolean configFileExists(){ return false; } } Now consider the following program, where the method getUnicorns produces an array of unicorns that depend on the player\u0026rsquo;s input. The specific type of objects in this array (Unicorn or EvilUnicorn) cannot be determined at compile time.\nUnicorn[] unicorns = getUnicorns(); for (Unicorn unicorn: unicorns){ System.out.println(unicorn.configFileExists()); } } In this example, the method of the superclass (i.e. Unicorn.configFileExists) will be executed for each object in the array, regardless of its type.\nThis is another reason why calling a static method via an instance (rather than via a class name) is often discouraged. In this example, writing Unicorn.configFileExists() would make it clear that this loop serves no purpose (the same method is executed unicorns.length times).\nReflection # Java (as well as C#) offers a mechanism called reflection to intuitively treat classes analogously to objects. Precisely, each class of a program (e.g. the class Unicorn) is associated with an object that represents it. This object is itself an instance of the Java class called Class. It can be accessed either:\nvia an instance of the class: Unicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(); Class unicornClass = myUnicorn.getClass(); or via the qualified name of the class (assuming for instance that the file Unicorn.java is in the folder \u0026lt;workingDirectory\u0026gt;/src/main/java/org/units): Class unicornClass = Class.forName(\u0026#34;org.units.Unicorn\u0026#34;); The instance methods of the class Class are listed here. Among others, they allow:\nlisting the attributes of the class, retrieving its immediate superclass, or the interfaces that it implements, creating a new instance of this class, etc. Reflection is a powerful feature. It is rarely used in everyday code, but can be helpful in specific situations. Notably, it is used (internally) by numerous Java frameworks such as Spring, Jackson or JUnit.\n"},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/env/sections/ide/","title":"IDE","section":"Development environment","content":" Integrated development environment (IDE) # An IDE is an application that consists of a source code editor with additional functionalities such as a debugger or build automation.\nFor this course, you can use any IDE (or enhanced code editor) for Java with at least the following features:\na debugger navigation to variable/class/interface declaration and usage, variable/class/interface renaming, Maven integration, Gradle integration if you choose the board game as your project. We give a brief overview of the most popular choices (for Java).\nEclipse, Netbeans and Intellij IDEA # All three of these editors have similar functionalities, and any of these three can be used for this course. All three were designed with Java in mind, and thus offer advanced integration with a variety of Java frameworks. Each of them also supports other programming languages, but the list varies from one editor to the other.\nAs of today, Intellij IDEA (IntelliJ for short) is probably the most popular Java-centric editor. This is a closed-source project, thus offering more limited customization than the other two.\nEclipse is an open-source project with a large ecosystem. It is known for its community support and its advanced plugin system, which led to the development of a variety of extensions over the years (including support for C/C++, Python, etc.). Note that for performance reasons, Eclipse comes with its own Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which in some (rare) cases may not behave like other JVMs.\nNetbeans is also an open-source project. Notably, Netbeans provides a graphical tool to design Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the Java Swing framework. However, we do not recommended using it for an advanced GUI (multiple windows, etc.), because the generated code can be very difficult to maintain or debug.\nVisual Studio Code (VSCode) # Warning. VSCode and Visual Studio are two independent programs, and serve different purposes. In particular, Visual Studio does not support Java (anymore). Note. VSCode is often categorized as a code editor rather than an IDE. For this course, VSCode (together with some plugins) can serve as a Java IDE, so we will refer to it as an IDE for simplicity. VSCode is a (mostly) open-source project developed by Microsoft. Precisely, Code-OSS is a (fully) open source editor, and VSCode is a distribution of Code-OSS with additional features.\nVSCode has probably become the most popular code editor among developers. For instance, VSCode is used by 74% of respondents of the 2023 StackOverflow developer survey.\nThe success of VSCode is often explained by its rich repository of (community-developed) plugins. This may in turn be explained by the fact that VScode is based on Electron, and thus allows writing plugins in Javascript.\nNote that VSCode was not developed as a Java code editor, but as a general-purpose editor with a focus on web development (Node.js/Javascript). However, VSCode can serve as a Java IDE (at least to some extent) thanks to some plugins. For this course, you may use the extension pack for Java. If you choose the board game as your project, you may also need a plugin for Gradle, such as this one.\nIn some cases, using VSCode may require a little bit more configuration than a Java-centric IDE.\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/docs/git/sections/sharing/","title":"Synchronization: remote, push, pull","section":"git","content":" Synchronization: remote, push, pull # List remotes # To list the remote(s) associated to your repository (name and address of each remote), you can run\ngit remote -v Upload # If the current branch is already shared with a remote, you can upload it with\ngit push Otherwise, you can share this branch (and its commits) with\ngit push -u \u0026lt;remoteName\u0026gt; \u0026lt;branchName\u0026gt; To delete a remote branch, run\ngit push \u0026lt;remoteName\u0026gt; -d \u0026lt;branchName\u0026gt; Alternatively, you can delete a remote branch using the web interface of your hosting service.\nDownload # If your current branch is shared with your remote, you can update your local copy with\ngit pull Warning.

For instance, the following program outputs \u0026ldquo;yellow\u0026rdquo;:\nUnicorn unicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;green\u0026#34;); Unicorn shallowCopy = unicorn; unicorn.color = \u0026#34;yellow\u0026#34;; System.out.println(shallowCopy.color); The need to duplicate an object may for instance appear in a program that uses concurrency.\nExercise In our game, the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component is in charge of rendering the game visually.\nThis component exposes a method called drawSnapshot that takes as input a game snapshot and draws this snapshot on screen. The backend calls this method whenever a snapshot must be drawn. However, the backend may send these snapshots faster than they can be displayed (due to the duration of on-screen animations).\nTo deal with this scenario, the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; buffers the snapshots that it receives (displaying a new snapshot only after all previously submitted ones have been displayed). For the sake of this exercise, you can think of this buffer as an array with type Snapshot[].\nNow consider the following method deleteUnit(int x, int y), executed by our backend each time it receives the instruction to delete a unit:\npublic class Backend implements EventHandler { Snapshot currentSnapshot; ... public void deleteUnit(int x, int y){ if(\u0026lt;\u0026#34;there is a unit on the tile x, y\u0026#34;\u0026gt;){ removeUnitFromTile(x, y); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); shiftUnitsInColumn(x); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); performUnitMerges(); drawSnapshot(currentSnapshot); } } } where the auxiliary methods removeUnitFromTile, shiftUnitsInColumn and performUnitMerges may modify the object currentSnapshot.\nObserve that the method deleteUnit calls drawSnapshot three times.\nNow let us assume that the buffer of the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; is nonempty when this method is executed, so that the 3 snapshots are added to the buffer, before any of them can be rendered on screen.\nHow many of these 3 snapshots will be drawn on screen?\nSolution Only the third snapshot will be drawn (three times), because the buffer contains three references to the same object. Deep copy # Copying a reference to an object can be viewed as the shallowest possible form of copy. As we saw already, this is what happens in Java when a variable with reference type is passed as argument.\nAt the other end of the spectrum is a so-called deep copy, where all attributes of the copied object are duplicated, recursively. In this case, the copy or any object that it references (recursively) can be modified without affecting their original counterparts.\nin Java # Java provides a native method called clone to duplicate objects. Like the methods toString and equals that we saw earlier, clone is an instance method of the native Java class Object, which is an (implicit) superclass of every other class.\nThe specification of the method clone is arguably vague:\nCreates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning of \u0026ldquo;copy\u0026rdquo; may depend on the class of the object. The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression:\nx.clone() != x will be true, and that the expression:\nx.clone().getClass() == x.getClass() will be true, but these are not absolute requirements.\nWhile it is typically the case that x.clone().equals(x) will be true, this is not an absolute requirement.\nNote. A class that overrides clone must implement the interface Cloneable, otherwise the program will throw a CloneNotSupportedException when this method is called. For instance:\npublic class Unicorn implements Cloneable { ... @Override public Unicorn clone(){ ... } } The interface Cloneable does not require implementing any additional method.\nRecursion # Warning. Similarly to what we saw with the methods toString or equals, beware of recursive implementations of clone if your program can create an object that refers to itself (directly or indirectly).

A text editor can open any file produced with a text editor (and more), regardless of the file\u0026rsquo;s extension.\nIn this sense, Microsoft Word is not a text editor (neither are Apple Pages or LibreOffice Writer).\nMost operating systems comes with one or several text editor(s) pre-installed, such as Notepad++ (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), gedit (default Ubuntu), etc.\nUsage # Your IDE is an (enhanced) text editor, so you can use it as such.\nBut it some scenarios, it can be useful to use a lighter program, for instance for:\nediting the configuration file of a program, modifying a small script (or even a single command-line instruction) copy-pasted from the web, etc. Among other reasons:\nopening an IDE can take time, if your IDE has autosave enabled, you may accidentally add unrelated files to your current project, etc. Advanced text editors # For most purposes, a basic text editor should be sufficient.\nBut depending on your workflow, you may want to try a more advanced one.\nVSCode # We already introduced VSCode in the section dedicated to IDEs.\nvi and emacs # We also bring to your attention two keyboard-centric editors called vi and emacs. Both were developed in the 70\u0026rsquo;s (before the mouse became a widespread peripheral) but are still commonly used today (in some form) by developers.\nWe do not recommend learning vi or emacs at this (early) stage of your studies, because it often requires time, and you arguably have more fundamental thing to learn. But you may give them a try at some point of your career, because they may significantly improve your productivity.\nvi/vim/neovim # vi was initially released 1978, as part of the first BSD distribution. The original program is rarely used today, but vim (for \u0026ldquo;vi improved\u0026rdquo;), released in 1991, and neovim, released in 2015 are still popular among developers. For instance, 22% (resp. 12%, non-exclusive) of respondents to the 2023 Stack Overflow developer survey use vim (resp. neovim) as a code editor.\nvi/vim/neovim is a so-called modal editor, meaning that users can switch between different modes. In one mode, pressing a standard key inserts the corresponding character on screen, whereas in another mode, pressing the same key has a different functionality (navigation, copy, paste, etc.). These functionalities are referred to as vi keybindings or vi motions, and allow performing a variety of text editing operations in an efficient way.\nvi keybindings are commonly used in applications other than vi/vim/neovim, with dedicated plugins. For instance, most code editors/IDEs (VSCode, IntelliJ IDEA, emacs, etc.), terminal emulators or even web browsers have plugins for vi keybindings.\nNote. Vim and neovim are very customizable, with comprehensive collections of (community-developed) plugins, which allows using them as IDEs. We do not recommend trying this at this stage of your studies, because configuration may require a very significant time investment (significantly more than VSCode for instance). The original vi still comes pre-installed on many operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, \u0026hellip;), and may be the default text editor opened by terminal-based applications (e.g. git) on your system. If this is the case (and if you do not know the vi keybindings), we recommend changing this setting. Emacs # Emacs was initially written in 1976. The most popular version is GNU Emacs, released in 91, was notably co-developed by Richard Stallman.\nEmacs is partly responsible for popularizing (sequences of) combinations of keys (e.g. Ctrl+\u0026lt;letter\u0026gt;), as opposed to modal editors like vi. GNU Emacs has more than 10 000 built-in commands, and also provides a (limited) mouse interface.\n5% of respondents to the 2023 Stack Overflow developer survey use emacs as a code editor.\nEmacs is also very customizable, with a comprehensive collections of (community-developed) plugins (probably more comprehensive than vim), and dedicated software repositories. Notably, Emacs tends to serve as a unique user interface for a variety of tasks (code editing, terminal emulation, email management, web browsing, playing music/videos, etc.). Note. Emacs can be used as an IDE, but for the same reason as for vim or neovim, we do not recommend trying this at this stage of your studies.

For instance, if our game only allows \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;green\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;red\u0026rdquo; as unit colors, then we may create a dedicated type that only allows these three values.\nIn Java # An enumerated type in Java is a set of constants. These constants are effectively static, meaning that they depends on the class or interface where the enumerated type is declared (similarly to a static attribute).\nThe name of an enumerated type can used similarly to a regular reference type. For instance\npublic class Unit { enum UnitColor {BLUE, GREEN, RED} int health; UnitColor color; public Unit(int health, UnitColor color){ this.health = health; this.color = color; } ... } Note. In the above example, the enumerated type UnitColor could equivalently be represented with an integer. For instance, 0 for blue, 1 for green and 2 for red. However, with such an encoding, a conditional statement (e.g. if or switch) that checks the color of a unit would also need to handle the case of values \u0026lt; 0 or \u0026gt; 2. So (besides readability), a benefit of the enumerated type in this case is that it restricts possible inputs to valid ones. Hint. Enumerated types in Java are significantly more expressive than their counterparts in some other languages. Notably, a Java enum can have its own constructor and methods. Record # A record is an immutable object (meaning that it cannot be modified).\nin Java # Records were introduced in Java 14 (2020). They are a convenient way to avoid boilerplate code. Records provide a concise syntax for \u0026ldquo;lightweight\u0026rdquo; classes that are only meant to hold data.\nFor instance, here is the full implementation of a record City:\npublic record City (String name, int zipCode) {} This record has an implicit constructor, and implements equals and hashcode in the expected way. For instance:\nCity rome = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100); City romeAgain = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100); // Outputs true. rome.equals(romeAgain) The attributes of a record cannot be modified. For instance, the following program does not compile:\nCity rome = new City(\u0026#34;Rome\u0026#34;, 00100); rome.zipCode = 00200; A record is often declared inside a class or interface. For instance, in our game:\npublic class Board { public record TileCoordinates(int X, int Y){}; ... Records are convenient for methods that need to return more than one value. For instance:\nTileCoordinates getOngoingMove(); Strings # Interning # Many modern languages (such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, etc.) support a technique called interning to manage strings in memory. It consists in storing only one copy of each distinct string created during the execution of a program. These strings are stored in a shared pool, and each of them is an immutable object. Some benefits are faster string comparisons, lower memory footprint, etc.\nin Java # In Java, a string is an object. Therefore comparing two variables of type String with == compares their references (like for any object):\nString myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Outputs false, because the two variables hold different references. System.out.println(myString == sameString); A string can be explicitly interned (i.e. added to the shared pool) with the (instance) method intern. This method:\ntries to add the string to the pool, and then returns a reference the (only) version of the string contained in the pool. For instance, consider the following program:\n// Creates a string \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, adds it to the pool, // and returns a reference to it. String myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;).intern(); String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Ouputs false. System.out.println(myString == sameString); // Tries to add \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; to the pool once again. // Because the pool already contains a version of \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, returns a reference to it. sameString = sameString.intern(); // Ouputs true, because the two variables now hold the same reference. System.out.println(myString == sameString); A string that is initialized without constructor (i.e. directly with \u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;) is interned. For instance\nString myString = \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;; String sameString = \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;; // Ouputs true, because of (implicit) interning System.out.println(myString == sameString); In order to support interning, string in Java are immutable. In particular, the instance methods of the class String do not modify a string. Instead they return (a reference to) a different object. For instance:\nString foo = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String copy = foo; // Ouputs true, because the two variables hold the same object reference. System.out.println(copy == foo); foo = foo.concat(\u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;); // Ouputs false, because the method concat returns a reference to another object. System.out.println(copy == foo); The class String overrides the method equals so that it implements string comparison in the expected way. For instance:\nString myString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); String sameString = new String(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;); // Outputs false. System.out.println(myString == sameString); // Outputs true. System.out.println(myString.equals(sameString)); Hint. By default, use equals to compare the values of two strings (rather than ==), because it is less error-prone.\nJava boxed types # Java has 8 primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char.\nFor each primitive type, Java has a so-called Boxed or (Wrapper) reference type: Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Boolean and Character\nThese types can be used in Java collections (Set, List, etc.), whereas primitive types cannot. Boxed types also offer additional functionalities, via instance methods (e.g. an Integer can represent a positive numbers up to \\(2^{32} - 1\\) ).\nConstructors for boxed types are deprecated. Instead, instances can be created via so-called autoboxing, for instance:\nInteger myInteger = 2; Character myCharacter = \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;; Several Java operators (like +, ==, \u0026lt;, etc) are also overloaded so that they behave with boxed types as they would with primitive types. For instance:\nInteger a = 1; a += 1; Integer b = 2; // Outputs true System.out.println(a == b); Like strings, boxed types are immutable. This can affect performance. For instance:\nfor (Integer i = 0; i \u0026lt; 1 000 000 ; i++){ } may create up to 1 million objects in memory. This is one of the reasons why it is usually recommended to use primitive types whenever possible (see for instance Effective Java, Item 61)\nSome boxed types are (partially) interned, analogously to strings.\n"},{"id":40,"href":"/docs/git/sections/ignore/","title":"Ignoring files","section":"git","content":" Ignoring files # You can add a file named .gitignore to the root folder of your repository.\nIt specifies files that cannot be staged.\nThis is commonly used to exclude from a repository:\ncompiled code (e.g. files with the extension .class in Java), dependencies (e.g. the content of the /node_modules folder in a Node.js project), IDE-generated files (e.g. the .idea/ folder for IntelliJ), OS-generated files (e.g. .DS_Store/ folders for macOS), etc. The .gitignore file uses a dedicated syntax to specify which files should be excluded.\nFor instance the pattern *.class excludes all files with the extension .class.\nHere is a quick tutorial about the syntax of .gitignore files.\nThis repository also contains a large collection of .gitignore patterns, for different programming languages, operating systems, programs, etc. For instance Java, VSCode, IntelliJ, Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.\n"},{"id":41,"href":"/docs/env/sections/terminal/","title":"Terminal","section":"Development environment","content":" Terminal # Using a terminal can be necessary during development, in order to execute a program that does not have a graphical user interface (GUI).\nBut even when a GUI is available, a Command Line Interface (CLI) can still be the preferred way to interact with some programs.

For instance, we can call this subfolder workspace. To create this folder, open a terminal and run:\nmkdir workspace Then navigate to this folder with the command cd (you do not need to type the full name of the directory, just type cd w, and press the Tab key for autocompletion):\ncd workspace Next, we will (loosely) follow the quick start tutorial for Hugo. Explanations about some of the command below can be found here.\nCopy-paste the following instruction and press Enter:\nhugo new site mySite This will create a project in a fresh folder called mySite. Let us navigate to it (again, you can take advantage of autocompletion):\ncd mySite Now copy-paste the following commands to declare this folder as a git repository and download a graphical theme for our website:\ngit init git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke echo \u0026#34;theme = \u0026#39;ananke\u0026#39;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; hugo.toml Navigation # At any moment, you can run the command:\npwd to display the current directory. With this command, you can check that you are indeed in the folder mySite.\nTo get a overview of the content of the current folder, run:\nll To get a recursive overview of the content of this folder, run:\ntree In order to navigate to a certain subfolder in this tree, we can take advantage of the fuzzy finder. For instance, let us assume that we want to move to some folder called socials, but we forgot its exact path.\nRun:\nc This will display the paths to all directories in this tree. You can type characters to restrict your search, and use the up down arrow keys to select your destination. For instance, type the three character soc. The best matches are displayed at the bottom of the list. To select one of them, navigate up and down with the arrow keys and press Enter.\nNote. Thanks to fuzzy search, the characters that you type do not need to be contiguous in a path. For instance, when you typed soc, all paths containing these three letters (in that order, but not necessarily contiguous) were retained.\nNow let us navigate back to the mySite folder. Here we can use zoxide, which uses our path navigation history to guess our destination. Run:\nz mySite (or possibly fewer letters).\nSimilarly, to go back to the socials subfolder that we previously went to:\nz socials Alternatively, you can switch between your current location and the previous one (thanks to zoxide still) with:\nzz Starting the web server # Navigate (back) to the mySite folder (you should know how to do this by now), and run:\nhugo server This will start a local development server for our website. To visualize the site, open Firefox (from the app menu), and use the address displayed in the terminal (it should be http://localhost:1313/)\nTo stop the server (or any Linux process running in a terminal), go back to the terminal an press Ctrl+C.\nNext, we will add content to our website, while keeping the server running.\nTo restart the server, we can use our command history. Type the first letters of the command that we used above to start the serve (e.g. hu). By pressing the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through the commands that you already typed and start with these letters. Scroll until you find the command hugo server, and press Enter to restart the server.\nIn order to keep the server running, we will execute our next command in another terminal. You can create a new one by clicking on the boxed \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; icon:\nAdding content # Navigate to the (immediate) subfolder content of mysite. Then create a subfolder named posts:\nmkdir posts Navigate to this new folder. Then create a new text file called myPost.md. You can for instance do this with the command:\ngedit myPost.md which will open the file with the test editor \u0026ldquo;gedit\u0026rdquo;.\nNote. If you only type ge followed by Tab, the shell will suggest you a list of programs whose name starts with these letters. You can scroll through them by pressing Tab again, or add a letter to disambiguate your search.\nIn the text editor, copy-paste the following content:\n+++ title = \u0026#39;My First Post\u0026#39; date = 2024-01-14T07:07:07+01:00 +++ ## Introduction This is **bold** text, and this is *emphasized* text. ### Subsection This is a [link](https://gohugo.io) to the Hugo website.

Navigate to your home folder, for instance with:\ncd And list its content:\nll The file .zshrc should be there. Open this file with gedit:\ngedit .zshrc Note. Again, you can take advantage of autocompletion here. For instance, press ged followed by Tab followed by .z followed by Tab.\nTowards the end of this file, you will see the declaration of the alias:\nalias c=\u0026#39;cd $(find * -type d | fzf)\u0026#39; Let us create another useful alias. Ubuntu has a convenient command called xdg-open that opens a file with the default application associated to this file\u0026rsquo;s extension (this is the equivalent of a double-click in a graphical file browser). Let us set a simpler name than xdg-open to execute this command. For instance o (like \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;).\nFirst, let us check that the name o is not used already for another command. Open a new terminal and run:\no You should get a \u0026ldquo;command not found\u0026rdquo; message, which confirms that this command is free.\nNow let us add the following line to the .zshrc file:\nalias o=\u0026#39;xdg-open\u0026#39; Save the file and open a new terminal.\nYou can now use the o command to open any file.\nTo see this, let us navigate back to the socials folder that we were previously in (e.g. type z so, then up arrow key and then Enter). If you list the files in this folder (with ll), you will see that they have the .svg extension. To open one of these files, you can type o and the first letters of the name of the file, then Tab for autocompletion. This will open the file with the default image viewer application on this machine.\nScripts # If you want to use an alias to execute a (possibly complex) sequence of commands, then the preferred way is to write a script.\nFor instance, we could write a script that navigates to the mySite folder and then starts the hugo server. And we may use the alias ws (like \u0026ldquo;website\u0026rdquo;) to call this script (you can check that it is free).\nNavigate to the ~/bin folder, and create a text file called ws (for instance with gedit, as we did above for the post).\nIn this file, copy-paste the following:\n#! /bin/bash cd ~/workspace/mySite hugo server start Observe that these are the two instructions for the two tasks that we want to execute. Save the file, and make it executable by running:\nsudo chmod u+x ws To test your script, close all running instances of hugo (if any), e.g. with Ctrl + C, as explained above.\nNow regardless of your location, you can type ws to start the web server.\nNote. Linux shells (such as bash or zsh) support the same language for commands and scripts. This is a full-fledged programming language (with conditional statements, loops, etc.), where an instruction can also be a command. Terminal-based applications # To conclude the demo, we introduce a few convenient applications that run in a terminal.

Alice may refactor the implementation of the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; component, knowing that this will not affect Bob, who is currently working on the backend. This is why a common practice in object-oriented programming consists in hiding all attributes and methods of a new class by default, and make accessible only the ones that need to be (in particular, this is likely to be the default behaviour of your IDE).\nEncapsulation also largely dictates how libraries are structured. For instance, when you create a String in Java, you do not have access to the internal representation of the string object.\nin Java # Each attribute or method of a class can have an access modifier, which specifies which other classes can access it. For instance, the keywords private and protected below are access modifiers.\nprivate int myAttribute; protected int myMethod(){ return 1; } Definition. There are four levels of access in Java:\nprivate restricts access to the current class, \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; relaxes private by also allowing access from the folder of the current class (in Java, a folder for source code is called a package), excluding subfolders, protected relaxes \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; by also allowing access from the subclasses of the current class, public does not restrict access. Warning. There is no keyword for the \u0026ldquo;package-private\u0026rdquo; level. Instead, this is the default level for an attribute or method without access modifier. For instance, in the example below, the attribute myAttribute is package-private: int myAttribute; Here is a recap table from the Oracle tutorials:\nkeyword class package subclasses world private yes no no no none yes yes no no protected yes yes yes no public yes yes yes yes Warning. A method declared in an interface is (implicitly) public. Warning. If a method m1 overrides (or implements) a method m2, then m1 must be at least as accessible as m2. Warning. An object can always access the attributes that it inherits (even if they are declared private). Exercise The following program does not compile. Can you see why, and how to fix this?\n├── Run.java └── units ├── Unit.java └── impl └── Unicorn.java public class Run { void testUnicorn(){ Unicorn myUnicorn = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;Storm\u0026#34;); myUnicorn.name = \u0026#34;Tornado\u0026#34;; } } public abstract class Unit { static String configFolder = \u0026#34;path/to/config\u0026#34;; } public class Unicorn extends Unit { String name; public Unicorn (String name){ this.name = name; } public static String getConfigFilePath (){ return configFolder + \u0026#34;/unicorn.properties\u0026#34;; } } Solution Unicorn.getConfigFilePath tries to access the package-private attribute Unit.configFolder (it should be made protected of public), Run.getConfigFilePath, tries to access the package-private attribute name of myUnicorn (it should be made public). Hint. Your IDE may suggest how to fix such compilation errors.\nTo improve encapsulation, it is good practice to restrict access whenever possible (i.e. without compromising compilation).\nHint. As a rule of thumb, in Java:\nuse private by default for all attributes and methods that you create, and if the program does not compile, then use your IDE to relax access. Exercise Encapsulation in this program can be improved. Can you see how?\n├── Run.java └── units ├── Unit.java └── impl └── Unicorn.java public class Run { void testUnicorn(){ Unicorn u1 = new Unicorn(); Unicorn u2 = new Unicorn(); u1.attack(u2); } } public abstract class Unit { public int health; public Unit(int health) { this.health = health; } public void attack(Unit defender){ int copy = health; health -= defender.health; defender.health -= copy; } } public class Unicorn extends Unit { public Unicorn (){ super(1); } @Override public void attack(Unit defender){ regen(); super.attack(defender); } public void regen(){ health += 1; } } Solution Unit.health can be made private, the constructor of Unit can be made protected, Unit.attack can be made protected, Unicorn.regen can be made private. Note. The constructor of an abstract class can always be made protected (since it can only be called in the constructor of a subclass). Getters and setters # For attributes, the notion of \u0026ldquo;access\u0026rdquo; can be refined. An attribute may be:\nneither visible not modifiable, or only visible, or only modifiable, or both visible and modifiable. This can be achieved with private attributes and so-called \u0026ldquo;getter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;setter\u0026rdquo; methods. For instance, in the following class, the attribute health has public visibility but is not modifiable.\npublic class Unicorn { private int health; public int getHealth(){ return health; } } Conversely, in the following class, the attribute health can be modified but is not visible.\npublic class Butterfly { private int health; public void setHealth(int health){ this.health = health; } } Hint. Getter and setter methods can be automatically generated by your IDE. To go further: inheritance violates encapsulation # Composition # Example (from Effective Java, Item 18).\nConsider a class MyHashSet that extends Java\u0026rsquo;s Hashset functionality by keeping track of the number of objects added to the set (as opposed to the output of HashSet.size(), which returns the numer of elements remaining in the set).\nThis class myHashSet may have an attribute int insertions (initialized to 0) that keeps track of the number of elements added to the set so far. And it may be implemented by overriding add and addAll in the expected way, i.e.:\n@Override public boolean add(E e){ counter++; return super.add(e); } @Override public boolean addAll(Collection\u0026lt;? extends E\u0026gt; c){ counter += c.size(); return super.addAll(c); } However, this implementation would count every insertion twice, because the implementation of HashSet.addAll relies on HashSet.add.\nA design pattern called composition can be used to avoid such unintended effects. Intuitively, instead of extending the original class, use an instance Hashset set of it as a (private) attribute of the new class. However, this requires re-implementing all methods of the original class (albeit in a straightforward way), for instance:\npublic boolean isEmpty(){ return set.isempty(); } Prevent overriding or inheritance # As show by the example above, in order to improve encapsulation, it may desirable in some scenarios to forbid overriding a method or extending a class. In Java, this can be enforced with the keyword final, for instance:\npublic final class NonExtensibleClass { ... } public class MyClass{ public final void nonOverridableMethod(){ ... } } "},{"id":43,"href":"/docs/git/sections/resources/","title":"To go further","section":"git","content":" To go further # Here is a brief selection of resources about git (among many):\na (short) video that goes beyond the content of this chapter, the Atlassian git tutorials, the GitHub training material, guidelines about how to write an informative (yet readable) commit message.

In addition, the documentation and help that you may find online overwhelmingly relies on its CLI.\nPossible explanations are efficiency (autocompletion, aliases, scripts, etc.), transparency, reproducibility, stability over time, etc.\nIf you you use git via CLI, then we recommend using a modern shell for command autocompletion. In particular, if you are using Windows, consider using git bash or the posh-git extension for Powershell.\nIf you want a flavor of how a terminal can be configured (for git and other purposes), then you can follow the demo in the dedicated chapter.\nHosting service # To collaborate via git and/or back up your repositories, you need to use a git hosting service.\nPopular options are GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket.\nThe Unibz also offers a self-hosted Gitlab service.\n"},{"id":47,"href":"/docs/background/","title":"Background","section":"Docs","content":" Background # This chapter gathers basic notions that are used throughout other chapters.\n"}]
