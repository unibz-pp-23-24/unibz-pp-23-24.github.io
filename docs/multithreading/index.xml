      <description>Concurrency # Core # A core is a basic processing unit. A Central Processing Unit (CPU) contains one or several cores (e.g. 4 or 8).&#xA;A Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) can contain thousands of cores.&#xA;Parallelism vs concurrency # Terminology. We call time span of a (computational) tasks the time interval comprised between the task&amp;rsquo;s start and completion. The time spans of two tasks may overlap.&#xA;Example. While downloading a video, Alice may use git to commit changes to her repository.</description>

      <description>Thread # Process # A process is (usually) an instance of a computer program. Processes can interact in several ways. In particular:&#xA;a process may spawn another process, a process may wait for another process to finish, two processes may have access the same resources. Thread # A process consists of one or several threads. Conceptually, a thread is similar to a process. In particular, threads can interact analogously to processes.</description>

      <description>A simplified view # From an abstract perspective, in order to understand the properties of a program that allows concurrency and/or parallelism, it can be convenient to assume an simplified, ideal machine that:&#xA;has an unlimited number of cores, and relies exclusively on parallelism. Parallel computation # In this section, we borrow the simple syntax for parallel computation used in the popular textbook Introduction to algorithms.&#xA;This syntax extends imperative pseudocode with three keywords:</description>

      <title>Race condition</title>
      <link>https://unibz-pp-23-24.github.io/docs/multithreading/sections/race/</link>

      <description>Race condition # Definition. A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program may vary depending on the order in which two threads access a resource. Illustrations # Example. The following program (in pseudocode) apparently increments variable i twice. However, it may output either 1 or 2, depending on the execution environment:&#xA;int i = 0 spawn i++ i++ sync print(i) The reason is that a core does not increment the value of a variable as an atomic operation.</description>

      <description>Synchronization # Precedence # Let $a_1$ (resp. $a_2$) be an instruction executed in a thread $t_1$ (resp. $t_2$). By default, if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are executed concurrently, there is no guarantee that $a_1$ is executed before $a_2$. However, most programming languages provide mechanisms to enforce it.&#xA;in Java # The Javadoc of the package java.util.concurrent summarizes the situations where a statement must be executed before another. In Java&amp;rsquo;s terminology, this binary relation over statements is called the &amp;ldquo;happens before&amp;rdquo; relation.</description>

      <description>Troubleshooting # Aside from race conditions, here are some common reasons why a program involving concurrency may not behave as intended.&#xA;Deadlock # Terminology. A deadlock occurs when two threads wait for each other to release a lock. This notion also generalizes to cyclic deadlocks involving more than two threads.&#xA;In Java, this may for instance be caused by synchronized methods or statements. A simple illustration can be found here.</description>

      <description>Abstractions # We review here some higher-level utilities available in Java to implement concurrency while reducing the risk of unwanted behaviors.&#xA;Thread safety # Terminology. A method is said to be tread-safe if it can be accessed by concurrently by several threads without &amp;ldquo;unexpected behavior&amp;rdquo;. Thread safety is a vague term, which may for instance refers to implementations that are free of race conditions.&#xA;Most high-level libraries or frameworks that exploit concurrency provide methods with some from of thread safety.</description>
