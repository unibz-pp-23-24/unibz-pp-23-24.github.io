      <description>Pattern matching # Two of the main uses of regexes are:&#xA;string validation, i.e. check whether a string satisfies certain constraints. For instance: has at least one digit and one special character, is a valid address, etc. string search, i.e. identify occurrences of a pattern in a line or in a file. This can be useful for: replacing strings in a file or a folder (e.g. within a codebase), splitting a sentence into (natural language) words, splitting a program into meaningful substrings, e.</description>

      <description>Regexes in practice # Concrete regexes deviate from theoretical ones in several ways. In particular:&#xA;Concrete syntaxes include a wide range of syntactic sugar, i.e. operators that could in theory be expressed in terms of |, * and concatenation.&#xA;Many regex engines support expressions with features (such as backreferences) that go beyond the expressivity of theoretical regexes. Technically, such expressions do not qualify as as regexes (they may describe a language that is not regular).</description>

      <description>Using Java regexes # Escaping \ # A regex in Java is a string.&#xA;Recall that within a Java string, a \ character must be escaped (i.e. written \\) to be read as a normal character. So in a Java string that represents a regex, every \ should be written \\.&#xA;Example. The string &amp;quot;[A-Z]\\d+&amp;quot; represents the regex [A-Z]\d+ Hint. This is another good reason for using a regex validation tool (e.</description>
