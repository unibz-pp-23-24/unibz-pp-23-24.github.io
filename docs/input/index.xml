      <description>Paths and files in Java # Java&amp;rsquo;s initial package for input/output (I/O) is called java.io. A central class in this package is File.&#xA;Over the years, programmers realized that this package had limitations: limited error handling, limited support for file metadata (owner, access rights, etc.), and some performance issues.&#xA;With Java 7 (2011), A new I/O package called NIO2 was released, with additional features (and in some cases a more concise syntax).</description>

      <description>Reading from and writing to a file in Java # There are numerous ways to read from or write to a file in Java, using either native of external libraries.&#xA;We highlight here some of the simplest ones (syntactically), even though they may not be the most efficient.&#xA;We also restrict our scope to:&#xA;reading and writing text (but Java also offers multiple ways to read or write sequences of bytes), reading sequentially and writing by appending (but some classes like RandomAccessFile allow accessing any position in a file).</description>

      <description>Configuration files # It is common practice for an application to store parameters (e.g. user-specific settings) in configuration files.&#xA;A configuration file may be edited manually and/or via a graphical interface.&#xA;Configuration files may use different serialization formats. Some popular formats are INI, JSON, TOML, YAML or XML.&#xA;in Java # Java provides native support for at least two configuration file serialization formats: XML and the so-called &amp;ldquo;property file&amp;rdquo; format.</description>

      <description>Serialization # Serializing an object (resp. data structure) means converting it into a form that can be stored or transmitted, and such that the object (resp. data structure) can be later reconstructed (a.k.a. deserialized). in Java # Java provides a native mechanism to serialize an object (including information about the type of the object). The serialization format is not (meant to be) human-readable.&#xA;The process is JVM independent, meaning that an object can be serialized on one platform and deserialized on another.</description>

      <description>JSON serialization # A number of (external) libraries allow transforming Java objects into JSON objects and conversely. For instance Jackson, Gson, JSON-java, JSON-B and JSON-P.&#xA;In this section, we focus on Jackson.&#xA;Note. Jackson was initially designed for JSON, but extensions of Jackson allow manipulating other formats: XML, TOML, YAML, CSV and Java property files. Install # Jackson can be used within a Maven project, by declaring the following dependency</description>
