      <description>Linear recursion # Definition. A recursive method is linear recursive if it performs at most one recursive call each time it is executed. Terminology. The term unary recursion is sometimes used to refer to linear recursive methods (as opposed to n-ary recursion). Hint. A linear recursive algorithm is often easy to transform into an iterative one (i.e. using loops only). Example # Exercise Write in pseudocode a (linear) recursive algorithm for a method int occ(char[] A, char c) that:</description>

      <description>N-ary recursion # Definition.&#xA;A recursive method that is not linear recursive uses n-ary recursion.&#xA;Specific cases are:&#xA;binary recursion if a method performs up to two recursive calls each time it is executed, ternary recursion if it performs up to three recursive calls each time it is executed, etc. Examples.&#xA;The algorithm seen earlier to print all files in a folder uses n-ary recursion.&#xA;The binary tree algorithms seen earlier all use binary recursion.</description>
