      <description>Evaluation # Evaluation for this course is based on:&#xA;assignments: up to 30 points, a group project: up to 60 points, and an oral exam: up to 10 points. Your final grade is the sum of the above, multiplied by 0.3.&#xA;Assignments # There are 6 assignments for this course. These are standard programming exercises, related to notions seen during the lectures. The labs are (mostly) dedicated to these assignments.</description>

      <description>Content of the course # This is a beginner&amp;rsquo;s course on imperative and (class-based) object oriented programming, with an emphasis on practice and collaboration.&#xA;The course relies on Java as main programming language. However, an important number of notions and techniques apply to other (imperative and/or object-oriented) programming languages: C/C++, C#, Javascript, Go, Kotlin, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Rust, Ruby, Typescript, Visual Basic, etc.&#xA;Prerequisites # Students are expected to have completed the Computer Programming course (INF/01 76258).</description>

      <description>Bibliography # Java&amp;rsquo;s syntax # In each chapter of this course, you will find Java code snippets that illustrate how to perform certain operations. However, this documentation is far from exhaustive (on purpose). In particular, alternative syntaxes are often available for the same (or similar) operations, either within the Java standard library, or in additional libraries such as Guava or the Apache commons libraries. For instance, there are multiple ways to read a file in Java.</description>
