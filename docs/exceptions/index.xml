      <description>Call stack # A call stack is a stack that keeps track of the methods that are active during the execution of a computer program. By &amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo;, we mean that an execution of the method has started, but has not terminated yet.&#xA;When the execution of a method starts, it is added to the stack. When it terminates, the method is removed from the stack, and control is passed back to the method that called it.</description>
