<a class=anchor href=#windows>#</a></h2><h3 id=benefits-and-drawbacks>Benefits and drawbacks
<a class=anchor href=#benefits-and-drawbacks>#</a></h3><p>Here are some <strong>benefits</strong> of using Windows as your OS <em>for software development</em>:</p><ul><li>it comes pre-installed on most PCs,</li><li>it is compatible out-of-the-box with most hardware,</li><li>it provides a <em>fully integrated development suite</em> for the .NET framework (C#, F#, Visual Basic), and to a lesser extent C/C++.</li></ul><p>And some <strong>drawbacks</strong>:</p><ul><li>for general-purpose development, Windows is <em>not friendly to new programmers</em> (compared to Linux or macOS),</li><li>the usage of an (OS-wise) package manager is (still) not the norm,</li><li>it sometimes favors backwards compatibility over compliance with modern standards.</li></ul><h3 id=when-to-use-windows-and-when-not>When to use Windows (and when not)
<a class=anchor href=#when-to-use-windows-and-when-not>#</a></h3><p>Windows is the OS of choice for developing software meant to run on Windows only, or cross-platform software written in one of the .NET languages (mostly C#).
C# is notably used for <em>game development</em> (e.g. for Unity) and <em>graphical interfaces</em> (although Javascript-based graphical frameworks may have become more popular lately).
Another interesting feature of C# (compared to Java) is the Language Integrated Query framework, which provides a tight integration with database engines.</p><p><a href=https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>Visual studio</a> (<em>not</em> VSCode!) offers a fully integrated development suite for the .NET languages, and is also commonly used for C/C++.</p><p>For other programming languages, using Windows may require <em>extra efforts</em> or <em>precautions</em> (compared to Linux or macOS), especially for new developers.</p><p>In particular, <em>manual software installation/upgrade/removal</em> can be complex and error-prone.
<em>Writing scripts</em> (e.g. for two programs to interact) can also be more involved, especially given the fact that Windows has three shells (the Windows shell, the Windows Power Shell and Power Shell), or four if counting WSL.</p><p>Besides, additional care must be taken to write <em>platform-independent</em> code.
Here are for instance two frequent sources of errors made by students:</p><ol><li><strong>Path names:</strong> Windows uses <code>\</code> as a path separator, as opposed to the <code>/</code> used by other OSs (or in web URIs).</li></ol><blockquote class="book-hint danger">In Java, a path can be safely written with <code>/</code>.
At run time (i.e. when the program is executed), this symbol will be interpreted based on the underlying OS (i.e. as <code>\</code> on Windows, and as <code>/</code> on other OSs).
However, a path written with <code>\</code> will be interpreted as such (therefore the program will throw an exception on OSs other than Windows).</blockquote><ol start=2><li><strong>Line breaks:</strong> many text editors for Windows encode a line break as <em>two</em> ascii characters (<code>\r\n</code>), against a <em>single</em> character (<code>\n</code>) on most modern systems.
This is often transparent for regular users, because many text editors (or even git) use detection and normalization procedures for line breaks.
However, this may be a source of bugs for developers, for instance when generating code, or when writing a script to configure a virtual environment (e.g. a Docker image).</li></ol><h3 id=for-this-course>For this course
<a class=anchor href=#for-this-course>#</a></h3><p>You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using Windows (even if your collaborators use other OSs).</p><p>However, you may need to pay <em>extra attention</em>, for instance to path names (as explained above).
Installing and configuring the necessary software may also be more complex (again, we recommend using a <a href=https://unibz-pp-23-24.github.io/docs/env/sections/install/#package>package manager</a> when possible).</p><p>If you do not manage to set up your working environment for this course (see the <a href=https://unibz-pp-23-24.github.io/docs/env/sections/requirements/>requirements</a>) in a short amount of time, then consider using a Linux distribution instead (see the <a href=#linux_install>dedicated section</a> below for using Linux alongside Windows).</p><h2 id=macos>macOS
<a class=anchor href=#macos>#</a></h2><p>Here are some benefits of using macOS as your OS <strong>for software development</strong>:</p><ul><li>it comes <strong>pre-installed</strong> with an Apple computer,</li><li>it is POSIX-compliant (since 2001), thus offering easier <strong>interoperability</strong> with Linux/BSD/Android/IOS</li><li>the Homebrew package manager is relatively mature.</li></ul><p>And some drawbacks:</p><ul><li>some software may not be available,</li><li>your working environment is not easily customizable.</li></ul><h3 id=when-to-use-macos-and-when-not>When to use macOS (and when not)
<a class=anchor href=#when-to-use-macos-and-when-not>#</a></h3><p>MacOS is rarely used on hardware other than Apple computers.</p><p>It is often a good choice for new developers.
In particular, Homebrew offers an easy way to install programs needed for general-purpose development (compilers, interpreters, other package managers, etc.), and its software repository is reasonably comprehensive in that regard (albeit smaller than repositories used by Linux distributions).</p><p>A number of more experienced developers also work with macOS, notably for web development (Node.js/Javascript) or data science related projects (Python).</p><p>A Linux distribution may be more convenient in some situations, e.g. when developing a program meant to run on a server, or when working with Docker containers.</p><p>Another drawback is the lack of customization of your working environment (largely bound to Apple proprietary software), which can a limitation for more experienced programmers.</p><h3 id=for-this-course-1>For this course
<a class=anchor href=#for-this-course-1>#</a></h3><p>If you have a Apple laptop, then you should not need an OS other than macOS for this course (even if your collaborators use other OSs).</p><h2 id=linux>Linux
<a class=anchor href=#linux>#</a></h2><p>Here are some benefits of using Linux as your OS <strong>for software development</strong>:</p><ul><li>it is used by most <strong>servers</strong>,</li><li>it is relatively lightweight,</li><li>for developers, it has an important (and high-quality) online community support,</li><li>(OS) package managers are mature and easy to use,</li><li>your working environment can be easily customized and/or configured.</li></ul><p>And some drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Linux rarely comes pre-installed on a computer,</li><li>there is sometimes <strong>too much choice</strong> of programs or distributions,</li><li>Linux distributions are (still) not as friendly to <strong>desktop users</strong> as Windows or macOS,</li><li>Hardware support (e.g. for peripherals) is (still) more limited than for Windows.</li></ul><h3 id=when-to-use-linux-and-when-not>When to use Linux (and when not)
<a class=anchor href=#when-to-use-linux-and-when-not>#</a></h3><p>Linux is often the OS of choice for developing programs meant to run on servers.
It is also a good choice for writing cross-platform software.</p><p>Linux (together with macOS) is also a good environment to learn the basics of programming, due to native compatibility with a wide range of technologies for general-purpose development (e.g. Docker).
Software installation, configuration, upgrade and removal is also made easier by mature package managers.
Besides, the Linux <strong>shell</strong> is a versatile yet relatively simple tool that can ease process management or interaction between programs.</p><p>Linux is arguably <strong>not</strong> the best choice for developing Desktop applications that target a specific OS (such as Windows or macOS), or in some specific domains such as game development.</p><h3 id=for-this-course-2>For this course
<a class=anchor href=#for-this-course-2>#</a></h3><p>You should be able to complete all assignments and write your project using a Linux distribution (even if your collaborators use other OSs).</p><p>In particular, if you face important issues when setting up your working environment (git, JDK, Maven, Gradle, etc. ) on Windows, we recommend using a Linux distribution instead, because it may save you time.
Keep in mind however that this will not solve issues related to the configuration of your IDE.</p><p>Not that you can use Linux (for development) and Windows (for other purposes) on the <strong>same</strong> computer.</p><h3 id=which-distribution-to-choose>Which distribution to choose
<a class=anchor href=#which-distribution-to-choose>#</a></h3><p>You can use any (reasonably mainstream) <strong>all-purposes</strong> Linux distribution for this course (and other courses).</p><p>The choice may seem overwhelming at first sight, but most distributions are forks of a few popular ones (Debian, Fedora, Arch, &mldr;), and are relatively similar to each other.
Besides, Linux environments are highly customizable: for instance, the choice of a distribution does not bind you to its default desktop environment.
Available software is also very similar from one distribution to another: regardless of the distribution, you will have access to openJDK, git, Maven, etc. via a package manager.</p><p>Distributions that are more desktop-oriented can be more friendly to newcomers (especially non-developers), but also come with unnecessary software.
Two popular distributions in this category (for new users) are Linux Mint and Zorin OS.
Both are forks of Ubuntu, which is itself a fork of Debian.</p><p>For a (slightly) more lightweight distribution, MX Linux is currently a popular choice.
It is also based on Debian.</p><h3 id=linux_install>How to install a Linux distribution
<a class=anchor href=#linux_install>#</a></h3><p>Most distributions provide detailed instructions on their web page.</p><p>Regardless of the distribution, you have are (at least) three possible options:</p><ol><li><p><strong><em>Virtual machine (such as VirtualBox).</em></strong>
This is the simplest option in terms of installation.
But also the most expensive computationally, so only suited to a relatively powerful computer.
Performance is also suboptimal.</p><p>A virtual machine is often good way to test a distribution before properly installing it.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Bootable drive.</em></strong>
You can store your Linux distribution on an external hard drive, and boot on Linux when the hard drive is connected to your computer
Compared to the third options below, this may affect the performance of disk access.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Partition (with dual boot).</em></strong>
You can dedicate a certain amount of space to a Linux distribution your hard drive.
A minimum of 30 GB is often recommended, but this can be adjusted later on.
When starting your computer, it will let you choose which OS to boot on.
This is the best option in terms of performance.</p></li></ol><blockquote class="book-hint warning">For the third option, the installation procedure has become more involved on some recent computers due to encrypted disks or so-called &ldquo;secure boot&rdquo;.
