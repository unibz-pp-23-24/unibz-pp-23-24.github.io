<a class=anchor href=#integrated-development-environment-ide>#</a></h1><p>An IDE is an application that consists of a source code editor with additional functionalities such as a debugger or build automation.</p><p>For this course, you can use any IDE (or enhanced code editor) for Java with at least the following features:</p><ul><li>a debugger</li><li>navigation to variable/class/interface declaration and usage,</li><li>variable/class/interface renaming,</li><li>Maven integration,</li><li>Gradle integration if you choose the board game as your project.</li></ul><p>We give a brief overview of the most popular choices (for Java).</p><h2 id=eclipse-netbeans-and-intellij-idea>Eclipse, Netbeans and Intellij IDEA
<a class=anchor href=#eclipse-netbeans-and-intellij-idea>#</a></h2><p>All three of these editors have similar functionalities, and any of these three can be used for this course.
All three were designed with Java in mind, and thus offer advanced integration with a variety of Java frameworks.
Each of them also supports other programming languages, but the list varies from one editor to the other.</p><p>As of today, Intellij IDEA (IntelliJ for short) is probably the most popular Java-centric editor.
This is a <strong>closed-source</strong> project, thus offering more limited customization than the other two.</p><p>Eclipse is an open-source project with a large ecosystem.
It is known for its community support and its advanced plugin system, which led to the development of a variety of extensions over the years (including support for C/C++, Python, etc.)
Note that for performance reasons, Eclipse comes with its own Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which in some (rare) cases may not behave like other JVMs.</p><p>Netbeans is also an open-source project.
Notably, Netbeans provides a graphical tool to design Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the Java Swing framework.
However, we do <em>not</em> recommended using it for an <em>advanced</em> GUI (multiple windows, etc.), because the generated code can be very difficult to maintain or debug.</p><h2 id=visual-studio-code-vscode>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
<a class=anchor href=#visual-studio-code-vscode>#</a></h2><blockquote class="book-hint danger">VSCode and Visual Studio are two <em>independent programs</em>, and serve different purposes.
In particular, Visual Studio does <em>not</em> support Java (anymore).</blockquote><blockquote class="book-hint warning"><strong><em>Note.</em></strong> VSCode is often categorized as a code editor rather than an IDE.
For this course, VSCode (together with some plugins) can serve as a Java IDE, so we will refer to it as an IDE for simplicity.</blockquote><p>VSCode is a (mostly) open-source project developed by Microsoft.
Precisely, <em>Code-OSS</em> is a (fully) open source editor, and VSCode is a distribution of Code-OSS with additional features.</p><p>VSCode has probably become the most popular code editor among developers.
For instance, VSCode is used by 74% of respondents of the 2023 StackOverflow developer survey.</p><p>The success of VSCode is often explained by its rich repository of (community-developed) plugins.
This may in turn be explained by the fact that VScode is based on Electron, and thus allows writing plugins in Javascript, which has become the most popular language for developing GUIs.</p><p>Note that VSCode was not developed as a Java code editor, but as a general-purpose editor with a focus on web development (Node.js/Javascript).
However, VSCode can serve as a Java IDE (at least to some extent) thanks to some plugins.
For this course, you may use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack">extension pack for Java</a>.
If you choose the board game as your project, you may also need a plugin for Gradle, such as <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle">this one</a>.</p><p>In some cases, using VSCode may require a little bit more configuration than a Java-centric IDE.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#eclipse-netbeans-and-intellij-idea>Eclipse, Netbeans and Intellij IDEA</a></li><li><a href=#visual-studio-code-vscode>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
